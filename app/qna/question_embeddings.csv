Interview_Questions,10 Common Interview Questions and How to Answer Them,"1. Tell me about yourself. This warm-up question is your chance to make an impactful first impression. Be prepared to describe yourself in a few sentences. You can mention: 
Your past experiences and how they relate to the current jobHow your most recent job is tied to this new opportunityTwo of your strengthsOne personal attribute, like a hobby or an interest
The majority of this response leans on your past work experience, with a small dash of your personal life added at the end of the response. Keep your answer to two to four minutes.2. Why do you want to work for this company?The answer to this interview question should include specifics about the company, so you’ll need to do some pre-interview research. If, for example, the company is known for its collaborative culture, you could point out successes you’ve had while collaborating with a team. Look for company-specific information on their website and social channels. Pay attention to the company’s mission statement, values, and the ‘About us’ section. Explore employee-specific posts on social media to learn about the company’s culture or outreach programs. Combine this information with relatable skills to show your preparedness and enthusiasm for the company. 3. Why are you leaving your current role?When asked about leaving a previous job, be honest but positive. Even if you left a job under trying circumstances, keep your response short and upbeat. Here are some suggestions:
I’m looking for a company that better aligns with my values. I’m excited to find a company where I can grow my career. I’ve decided to go down a different career path.My position was downsized, but I’m looking forward to a new opportunity. I’m excited to explore a culture in line with my personality. I’m ready to take on a new challenge with an innovative company. I’ve aspired to work for this company and seized the chance to apply.Read more: Reasons for Leaving a Job and How to Talk About Them4. What is your biggest weakness?When it comes to identifying weaknesses, think about some conflicts you’ve had to overcome. Maybe it’s difficult for you to take criticism, collaborate, or make public presentations. Take these challenges and frame them with a solution. For instance, you learned to take feedback to better a project, collaborate to elevate a product’s offerings, or use presentations as a way to build your confidence. Read more: How to Describe Your Weaknesses in a Job Interview5. What do you consider your greatest achievement?Your greatest achievement should be something specific, like bringing a new video game to a saturated market despite a lack of resources. Discuss a work-related triumph as a way to humbly mention your achievements as opposed to listing awards or accolades. This achievement should also fall in line with the company’s mission, goals, or the position’s objectives.6. Tell me about a difficult situation you’ve faced and how you handled it. This question is really asking about your character during moments of stress. Think of a time when you faced an impossible deadline, had to choose sides, or navigated interoffice turmoil. Explain the problem, how you stayed calm, and focus on the solution that produced a resolution. 7. Give an example of how you’ve gone above and beyond your role requirements. While you might be tempted to mention the extra hours you put in or the additional tasks you take on, it’s best to showcase your skills with a story. Talk about the innovative methods you deployed to revive a stalled project or roles you filled when your team was downsized.   8. What are your salary expectations?Salary talks can be sensitive, but they’re necessary. Research a competitive salary before you go into your interview, so you don’t aim too high or low. You can use tools like a Salary Calculator or Salary Comparison and Estimator to get baseline compensation. Be sure to mention years of experience or specific certifications that enhance your value.   9. Where do you see yourself five years from now? Another common interview question looks at your five-year plan. You should promote your commitment to the company while looking toward growth opportunities.  More specifically, you can craft a response that explores your:
Position-related goalsPotential experiences within the company over the next five yearsPossible certifications, skills, or achievements you might obtainAspirations for growth within the role Read more: What Are Your Career Goals?10. Do you have any questions for us? Typically, this is the last question of the interview, and it might be tempting to say, “No. I’m all set.” However, this question allows you to show your interest in the position. Some questions you could ask include:What are the day-to-day tasks involved in this role?How do you evaluate the progress of this role? What ongoing educational or training opportunities could I pursue in this role?Where do you see the company in five years?How would you describe",-0.14459859,0.19978285,0.323778,-0.15969755,-0.028129252,0.153601,-0.21596788,0.15555966,-0.11264814,0.061858125,0.063589334,-0.028193846,0.20075184,-0.02213503,0.093166895,-0.25463128,0.20676753,0.12796508,-0.3734208,0.23745319,0.14452612,-0.10402349,0.13050653,-0.014289098,0.17000344,-0.08533127,-0.13953416,-0.46245062,0.09465923,-0.15505208,-0.1460484,0.5174221,-0.055461664,0.019719817,-0.01202571,0.31323606,-0.0496986,0.18668297,0.022092968,-0.15298209,-0.3410962,-0.21896172,0.08578509,-0.3590299,-0.18244973,0.074262716,0.15606233,-0.32257602,-0.1265663,-0.8031297,0.04272823,-0.050324492,0.11543634,1.0808382,-0.16583605,-2.3613958,0.095940314,-0.25852582,1.6348932,0.394805,-0.1520896,0.77375823,-0.26349425,0.073927455,0.75890934,0.011585665,0.43959707,0.28419295,0.16063152,-0.21460937,-0.006428468,-0.21880724,-0.1106375,-0.4292672,0.14896664,0.078548245,-0.19483192,-0.06366545,-0.7717676,-0.02702531,0.5360612,0.09645966,-0.41646475,0.09351712,-1.3773702,-0.1494482,0.13539618,-0.044599347,-0.16710782,-0.37220028,-0.105137,-0.0012679129,-0.08512585,-0.034721013,-0.4456603,-0.08268802,-0.1853113,-0.32728833,0.5906657,0.26989165

Interview_Questions,25 of the Most Difficult Interview Questions – And How to Answer Them,"﻿Character Interview Questions
Tell me about yourself
Tricky to answer for lots of reasons, not least because it’s often the first question an interviewer will ask. Avoid ‘umms’ and ‘ahhs’ by reviewing the profile section of your CV ahead of the interview and try to keep things to the point. 


What are your strengths?
Many people find it hard to ‘big themselves up’, but interviewers want to see confidence and self-assurance. Think about the feedback you’ve received from previous employers, and tailor your response to the type of role you’re applying for.


What are your weaknesses?
Describing your weaknesses is something of a balancing act; you need to demonstrate self-awareness without setting yourself up to fail. Reinforce your responses by asserting your willingness to improve, framing the role as a means to further develop your career. 


What motivates you?
A question where it is often prudent to bend the truth somewhat; your motivations may differ from what the interviewer wants to hear (better to not mention salary, for example). Instead, think about the bigger picture – particularly how you see your career unfolding.


Describe yourself in five words or less
A tricky question that can prove a real stumbling block. Think about your strengths and the words which encapsulate them; intuitive, creative, efficient are a few good examples to set you apart from other candidates.


how to ace an interview
CV and Work Experience Interview Questions
Tell us about your work history and experience
Typically, interviewers will have your CV in front of them, so it’s not necessary to list your entire work history. Instead, provide a summary, infusing your response with passion and additional details which may not be evident from your CV and application.


Could you explain this gap on your CV?
A question you need to prepare for. Explaining gaps in your CV can be tricky, but transparency is the best policy. Be honest and stay positive; you need to show that these setbacks aren’t what define you and your application.


Tell us about an achievement you’re proud of
This question may sound relatively straightforward, but it can be a tough nut to crack if you have limited past experience. If you’re applying for a role straight out of education, focus on academic or personal achievements, and hint at how this indirectly supports your application.


Why did you leave your previous role? 
Hiring managers want to find out how dependable you are, as well as what would motivate you to leave a position. Again, stay positive here, and avoiding bad-mouthing your previous employer if things ended on bad terms.


Why should we employ you?
It’s easy to generalise and repeat yourself with a question like this, so instead of echoing sentiments about your strengths and character, try to frame your response around the job criteria – which, after adequate pre-interview prep, should be front and centre in your mind.


Answering difficult interview questions
Company-Fit Interview Questions
What do you know about our business?
Another question that hinges on prep and research; head to the company’s website to find out everything you can about what they offer and how they work. LinkedIn can also be an invaluable resource, giving you an idea of company structure and tone.


What can you bring to the company?
Try not to repeat yourself with these kinds of questions, instead framing your response on the company culture and its values. Interviewers want to see your unique selling points – what can you offer that other candidates can’t?


Why do you want to work for us?
Another question where you may need to bend the truth, particularly if you’re applying for a job out of necessity or convenience. A little ego-baiting can go a long way here, so don’t be afraid to pile on the compliments and frame the company as one you’d be proud to work for.


What kind of environment do you enjoy working in?
Here, hiring managers want to see if your character meets the culture of the business. They may be looking for someone who thrives under pressure, or a candidate with a calm, dependable personality that is great at managing others.


What are your salary expectations?
An honest, frank approach works best when asked about salary expectations, so don’t hedge, and avoid ambiguity. Hiring managers understand that salary is important, and taking a firm but fair stance demonstrates self-assurance and confidence in your abilities.


Preparing for a job interview
Role-Fit Interview Questions
What will you do in the first 60 days in the role?
This question requires you to read between the lines of the job spec to understand what the business wants from the position. If you have an experience-led way of doing things, even better; interviewers want to see proactivity and a clear vision for the role.


What does success look like in this position?
Tying into the previous question, this is about getting a feel for how you measure success. Make clear your commitment to the role and frame your response around what you’ve learnt about the state of the business from the interviewer.


What can you bring to the role that other candidates can’t?
This is an opportunity to leverage your skills and knowledge, demonstrating how your previous experience or qualifications make you a strong contender for the position. Remember to refer back to the job criteria as often as possible, ensuring that you hit the interviewer’s tick-box points.


Why do you want this particular role?
There are lots of ways to answer this question. You could talk about how it feels like a natural next step on your career journey, or that you admire how the company works. Just be sure to make your answer as specific to the company and the job criteria as possible.


How does this position fit into your desired career path?
Here, businesses are looking to get a feel for where you see your career going over the next few years, and that you’re wholly committed to the role they’re offering. Stay positive and avoid discussing any big plans outside of your career.

Additional Questions
Where do you see yourself in five years?
“Working here” might seem like the answer interviewers want to hear, but it rarely is. Even if that is your goal, you can frame your answer better by discussing development and progression. And don’t be afraid to say otherwise. If you’re passionate about building your career with multiple businesses, this shows a level of proactivity and self-confidence that hiring managers should admire.


What is your dream job?
Similar to our last point, it’s no good trying to kid an interviewer that the position you’re applying for is your dream job, particularly if it’s a junior role. Be honest and transparent, while highlighting that the position you’re interviewing for is a vital first step towards achieving your goals.


How would past colleagues describe you?
Another way to highlight your strengths and character; here the interviewer wants to learn how you work with others. Remember, they may have contact with your previous colleagues and managers, so be honest and make your responses feasible and realistic.


What do you like to do outside of work?
Your response to this question depends on the tone and formality of the interview, something you’ll have to gauge yourself. Some interviewers are just curious and want to put you at ease, while others want to find out how confident and self-aware you are. Recall your CV and avoid overdoing it on the detail.


Do you have any questions for us?
 One of the most critical questions at any job interview, and one you absolutely must prepare for. Many candidates fail to realise that an interview is a two-way conversation, and one in which you need to make clear that a company is the right fit for you. Ask questions and start conversations – the longer you’re in the interview room talking, the better.",-0.14609519,0.20054287,0.38114733,-0.2015177,-0.112100065,0.15947895,-0.27300698,0.13740477,-0.08975324,0.022662919,0.09105125,-0.01982769,0.22592416,0.0039808075,0.087326676,-0.25167546,0.16495657,0.14364342,-0.3799875,0.24802105,0.11517738,-0.08909041,0.11486984,-0.089990176,0.15281181,-0.06947098,-0.12733603,-0.49694672,0.092325054,-0.18137841,-0.094247855,0.5274547,-0.028164158,0.016311618,-0.0055821594,0.29881892,-0.025936997,0.19221832,0.020166101,-0.18716358,-0.36079055,-0.22527415,0.08669524,-0.36607242,-0.24333806,0.027258536,0.15802525,-0.33466646,-0.1341349,-0.8076133,0.06657693,-0.049307488,0.12277274,1.088862,-0.1697092,-2.2879915,0.1259979,-0.2442784,1.5708188,0.3870088,-0.13396578,0.7724415,-0.26382446,0.074461885,0.7952525,0.024399433,0.4749449,0.30996844,0.1255288,-0.25065818,0.0100014135,-0.23462723,-0.08992924,-0.44352186,0.19482374,0.06746642,-0.15338309,-0.066012755,-0.73967534,-0.037565324,0.53126144,0.07019357,-0.47013572,0.070880905,-1.3906356,-0.19321273,0.092896506,-0.024086764,-0.18808202,-0.38497245,-0.11042062,-0.018607562,-0.06459763,-0.01611766,-0.44060972,-0.060276728,-0.18730229,-0.33367094,0.54769087,0.31897238

Interview_Questions,Top 45 Machine Learning Interview Questions & Answers 2023,"Top Machine Learning Interview Questions
Let's start with some commonly asked machine learning interview questions and answers.
1. What Are the Different Types of Machine Learning?
There are three types of machine learning:
Supervised Learning
In supervised machine learning, a model makes predictions or decisions based on past or labeled data. Labeled data refers to sets of data that are given tags or labels, and thus made more meaningful.

Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, we don't have labeled data. A model can identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the input data.

Reinforcement Learning
Using reinforcement learning, the model can learn based on the rewards it received for its previous action.

Consider an environment where an agent is working. The agent is given a target to achieve. Every time the agent takes some action toward the target, it is given positive feedback. And, if the action taken is going away from the goal, the agent is given negative feedback.

2. What is Overfitting, and How Can You Avoid It? 
The Overfitting is a situation that occurs when a model learns the training set too well, taking up random fluctuations in the training data as concepts. These impact the model’s ability to generalize and don’t apply to new data. 
When a model is given the training data, it shows 100 percent accuracy—technically a slight loss. But, when we use the test data, there may be an error and low efficiency. This condition is known as overfitting.
There are multiple ways of avoiding overfitting, such as:

Regularization. It involves a cost term for the features involved with the objective function
Making a simple model. With lesser variables and parameters, the variance can be reduced 
Cross-validation methods like k-folds can also be used
If some model parameters are likely to cause overfitting, techniques for regularization like LASSO can be used that penalize these parameters

3. What is ‘training Set’ and ‘test Set’ in a Machine Learning Model? How Much Data Will You Allocate for Your Training, Validation, and Test Sets?
There is a three-step process followed to create a model:

Train the model
Test the model 
Deploy the model



Training Set
Test Set




The training set is examples given to the model to analyze and learn
70% of the total data is typically taken as the training dataset
This is labeled data used to train the model




The test set is used to test the accuracy of the hypothesis generated by the model
Remaining 30% is taken as testing dataset
We test without labeled data and then verify results with labels




Consider a case where you have labeled data for 1,000 records. One way to train the model is to expose all 1,000 records during the training process. Then you take a small set of the same data to test the model, which would give good results in this case.
But, this is not an accurate way of testing. So, we set aside a portion of that data called the ‘test set’ before starting the training process. The remaining data is called the ‘training set’ that we use for training the model. The training set passes through the model multiple times until the accuracy is high, and errors are minimized.

Now, we pass the test data to check if the model can accurately predict the values and determine if training is effective. If you get errors, you either need to change your model or retrain it with more data.

Regarding the question of how to split the data into a training set and test set, there is no fixed rule, and the ratio can vary based on individual preferences. 
4. How Do You Handle Missing or Corrupted Data in a Dataset?
One of the easiest ways to handle missing or corrupted data is to drop those rows or columns or replace them entirely with some other value.
There are two useful methods in Pandas:

IsNull() and dropna() will help to find the columns/rows with missing data and drop them
Fillna() will replace the wrong values with a placeholder value


5. How Can You Choose a Classifier Based on a Training Set Data Size?
When the training set is small, a model that has a right bias and low variance seems to work better because they are less likely to overfit. 
For example, Naive Bayes works best when the training set is large. Models with low bias and high variance tend to perform better as they work fine with complex relationships.

6. Explain the Confusion Matrix with Respect to Machine Learning Algorithms.
A confusion matrix (or error matrix) is a specific table that is used to measure the performance of an algorithm. It is mostly used in supervised learning; in unsupervised learning, it’s called the matching matrix.
The confusion matrix has two parameters:

Actual
Predicted 

It also has identical sets of features in both of these dimensions.
Consider a confusion matrix (binary matrix) shown below:

Here,
For actual values:
Total Yes = 12+1 = 13
Total No = 3+9 = 12 
Similarly, for predicted values:
Total Yes = 12+3 = 15
Total No = 1+9 = 10 
For a model to be accurate, the values across the diagonals should be high. The total sum of all the values in the matrix equals the total observations in the test data set. 
For the above matrix, total observations = 12+3+1+9 = 25
Now, accuracy = sum of the values across the diagonal/total dataset
= (12+9) / 25
= 21 / 25
= 84%
7. What Is a False Positive and False Negative and How Are They Significant?
False positives are those cases that wrongly get classified as True but are False. 
False negatives are those cases that wrongly get classified as False but are True.
In the term ‘False Positive,’ the word ‘Positive’ refers to the ‘Yes’ row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix. The complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as a positive, but the actual value is negative. 

So, looking at the confusion matrix, we get:
False-positive = 3
True positive = 12
Similarly, in the term ‘False Negative,’ the word ‘Negative’ refers to the ‘No’ row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix. And the complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as negative, but the actual value is positive.
So, looking at the confusion matrix, we get:
False Negative = 1
True Negative = 9
8. What Are the Three Stages of Building a Model in Machine Learning?
The three stages of building a machine learning model are:


Model Building
Choose a suitable algorithm for the model and train it according to the requirement 

Model Testing
Check the accuracy of the model through the test data 

Applying the Model
Make the required changes after testing and use the final model for real-time projects

Here, it’s important to remember that once in a while, the model needs to be checked to make sure it’s working correctly. It should be modified to make sure that it is up-to-date.

9. What is Deep Learning?
The Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves systems that think and learn like humans using artificial neural networks. The term ‘deep’ comes from the fact that you can have several layers of neural networks. 
One of the primary differences between machine learning and deep learning is that feature engineering is done manually in machine learning. In the case of deep learning, the model consisting of neural networks will automatically determine which features to use (and which not to use).

The machine learns the features from the data it is provided
The problem is solved in an end-to-end manner




11. What Are the Applications of Supervised Machine Learning in Modern Businesses?
Applications of supervised machine learning include:


Email Spam Detection
Here we train the model using historical data that consists of emails categorized as spam or not spam. This labeled information is fed as input to the model.

Healthcare Diagnosis
By providing images regarding a disease, a model can be trained to detect if a person is suffering from the disease or not.

Sentiment Analysis
This refers to the process of using algorithms to mine documents and determine whether they’re positive, neutral, or negative in sentiment. 

Fraud Detection
By training the model to identify suspicious patterns, we can detect instances of possible fraud.

12. What is Semi-supervised Machine Learning?
Supervised learning uses data that is completely labeled, whereas unsupervised learning uses no training data.
In the case of semi-supervised learning, the training data contains a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

13. What Are Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques? 
There are two techniques used in unsupervised learning: clustering and association.
Clustering
Clustering problems involve data to be divided into subsets. These subsets, also called clusters, contain data that are similar to each other. Different clusters reveal different details about the objects, unlike classification or regression.

Association
In an association problem, we identify patterns of associations between different variables or items.
For example, an e-commerce website can suggest other items for you to buy, based on the prior purchases that you have made, spending habits, items in your wishlist, other customers’ purchase habits, and so on.

14. What is the Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning?

Supervised learning - This model learns from the labeled data and makes a future prediction as output 
Unsupervised learning - This model uses unlabeled input data and allows the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.

15. What is the Difference Between Inductive Machine Learning and Deductive Machine Learning? 


Inductive Learning
Deductive Learning




It observes instances based on defined principles to draw a conclusion
Example: Explaining to a child to keep away from the fire by showing a video where fire causes damage




It concludes experiences
Example: Allow the child to play with fire. If he or she gets burned, they will learn that it is dangerous and will refrain from making the same mistake again




16. Compare K-means and KNN Algorithms.


K-means
KNN





K-Means is unsupervised
K-Means is a clustering algorithm
The points in each cluster are similar to each other, and each cluster is different from its neighboring clusters





KNN is supervised in nature
KNN is a classification algorithm
It classifies an unlabeled observation based on its K (can be any number) surrounding neighbors




17. What Is ‘naive’ in the Naive Bayes Classifier?
The classifier is called ‘naive’ because it makes assumptions that may or may not turn out to be correct. 
The algorithm assumes that the presence of one feature of a class is not related to the presence of any other feature (absolute independence of features), given the class variable.
For instance, a fruit may be considered to be a cherry if it is red in color and round in shape, regardless of other features. This assumption may or may not be right (as an apple also matches the description).
18. Explain How a System Can Play a Game of Chess Using Reinforcement Learning.
Reinforcement learning has an environment and an agent. The agent performs some actions to achieve a specific goal. Every time the agent performs a task that is taking it towards the goal, it is rewarded. And, every time it takes a step that goes against that goal or in the reverse direction, it is penalized. 
Earlier, chess programs had to determine the best moves after much research on numerous factors. Building a machine designed to play such games would require many rules to be specified. 
With reinforced learning, we don’t have to deal with this problem as the learning agent learns by playing the game. It will make a move (decision), check if it’s the right move (feedback), and keep the outcomes in memory for the next step it takes (learning). There is a reward for every correct decision the system takes and punishment for the wrong one. 
19. How Will You Know Which Machine Learning Algorithm to Choose for Your Classification Problem?
While there is no fixed rule to choose an algorithm for a classification problem, you can follow these guidelines:

If accuracy is a concern, test different algorithms and cross-validate them
If the training dataset is small, use models that have low variance and high bias
If the training dataset is large, use models that have high variance and little bias

20. How is Amazon Able to Recommend Other Things to Buy? How Does the Recommendation Engine Work?
Once a user buys something from Amazon, Amazon stores that purchase data for future reference and finds products that are most likely also to be bought, it is possible because of the Association algorithm, which can identify patterns in a given dataset.

21. When Will You Use Classification over Regression?
Classification is used when your target is categorical, while regression is used when your target variable is continuous. Both classification and regression belong to the category of supervised machine learning algorithms. 
Examples of classification problems include:

Predicting yes or no
Estimating gender
Breed of an animal
Type of color

Examples of regression problems include:

Estimating sales and price of a product
Predicting the score of a team
Predicting the amount of rainfall

22. How Do You Design an Email Spam Filter?
Building a spam filter involves the following process:

The email spam filter will be fed with thousands of emails 
Each of these emails already has a label: ‘spam’ or ‘not spam.’
The supervised machine learning algorithm will then determine which type of emails are being marked as spam based on spam words like the lottery, free offer, no money, full refund, etc.
The next time an email is about to hit your inbox, the spam filter will use statistical analysis and algorithms like Decision Trees and SVM to determine how likely the email is spam
If the likelihood is high, it will label it as spam, and the email won’t hit your inbox
Based on the accuracy of each model, we will use the algorithm with the highest accuracy after testing all the models


23. What is a Random Forest?
A ‘random forest’ is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is generally used for classification problems. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during the training phase. The random forest chooses the decision of the majority of the trees as the final decision. 

24. Considering a Long List of Machine Learning Algorithms, given a Data Set, How Do You Decide Which One to Use?
There is no master algorithm for all situations. Choosing an algorithm depends on the following questions:

How much data do you have, and is it continuous or categorical?
Is the problem related to classification, association, clustering, or regression?
Predefined variables (labeled), unlabeled, or mix?
What is the goal?

Based on the above questions, the following algorithms can be used:

25. What is Bias and Variance in a Machine Learning Model?
Bias
Bias in a machine learning model occurs when the predicted values are further from the actual values. Low bias indicates a model where the prediction values are very close to the actual ones.
Underfitting: High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs. 
Variance
Variance refers to the amount the target model will change when trained with different training data. For a good model, the variance should be minimized. 
Overfitting: High variance can cause an algorithm to model the random noise in the training data rather than the intended outputs.
26. What is the Trade-off Between Bias and Variance?
The bias-variance decomposition essentially decomposes the learning error from any algorithm by adding the bias, variance, and a bit of irreducible error due to noise in the underlying dataset. 
Necessarily, if you make the model more complex and add more variables, you’ll lose bias but gain variance. To get the optimally-reduced amount of error, you’ll have to trade off bias and variance. Neither high bias nor high variance is desired.
High bias and low variance algorithms train models that are consistent, but inaccurate on average.
High variance and low bias algorithms train models that are accurate but inconsistent. 
27. Define Precision and Recall.
Precision
Precision is the ratio of several events you can correctly recall to the total number of events you recall (mix of correct and wrong recalls).
Precision = (True Positive) / (True Positive + False Positive)
Recall
A recall is the ratio of the number of events you can recall the number of total events.
Recall = (True Positive) / (True Positive + False Negative)
28. What is a Decision Tree Classification?
A decision tree builds classification (or regression) models as a tree structure, with datasets broken up into ever-smaller subsets while developing the decision tree, literally in a tree-like way with branches and nodes. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data. 
29. What is Pruning in Decision Trees, and How Is It Done?
Pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees. It reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting. 
Pruning can occur in:

Top-down fashion. It will traverse nodes and trim subtrees starting at the root
Bottom-up fashion. It will begin at the leaf nodes

There is a popular pruning algorithm called reduced error pruning, in which:

Starting at the leaves, each node is replaced with its most popular class
If the prediction accuracy is not affected, the change is kept
There is an advantage of simplicity and speed

30. Briefly Explain Logistic Regression.
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to predict a binary outcome for a given set of independent variables. 
The output of logistic regression is either a 0 or 1 with a threshold value of generally 0.5. Any value above 0.5 is considered as 1, and any point below 0.5 is considered as 0.

31. Explain the K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm. 
K nearest neighbor algorithm is a classification algorithm that works in a way that a new data point is assigned to a neighboring group to which it is most similar. 
In K nearest neighbors, K can be an integer greater than 1. So, for every new data point, we want to classify, we compute to which neighboring group it is closest. 
Let us classify an object using the following example. Consider there are three clusters:

Football
Basketball 
Tennis ball


Let the new data point to be classified is a black ball. We use KNN to classify it. Assume K = 5 (initially). 
Next, we find the K (five) nearest data points, as shown.

Observe that all five selected points do not belong to the same cluster. There are three tennis balls and one each of basketball and football. 
When multiple classes are involved, we prefer the majority. Here the majority is with the tennis ball, so the new data point is assigned to this cluster.
32. What is a Recommendation System?
Anyone who has used Spotify or shopped at Amazon will recognize a recommendation system: It’s an information filtering system that predicts what a user might want to hear or see based on choice patterns provided by the user.
33. What is Kernel SVM?
Kernel SVM is the abbreviated version of the kernel support vector machine. Kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, and the most common one is the kernel SVM.
34. What Are Some Methods of Reducing Dimensionality?
You can reduce dimensionality by combining features with feature engineering, removing collinear features, or using algorithmic dimensionality reduction.
Now that you have gone through these machine learning interview questions, you must have got an idea of your strengths and weaknesses in this domain.
35. What is Principal Component Analysis?
Principal Component Analysis or PCA is a multivariate statistical technique that is used for analyzing quantitative data. The objective of PCA is to reduce higher dimensional data to lower dimensions, remove noise, and extract crucial information such as features and attributes from large amounts of data.
36. What do you understand by the F1 score?
The F1 score is a metric that combines both Precision and Recall. It is also the weighted average of precision and recall. 
The F1 score can be calculated using the below formula:
F1 = 2 * (P * R) / (P + R)
The F1 score is one when both Precision and Recall scores are one.
37. What do you understand by Type I vs Type II error?
Type I Error: Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is true and we reject it.
Type II Error: Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is false and we accept it.

38. Explain Correlation and Covariance?
Correlation: Correlation tells us how strongly two random variables are related to each other. It takes values between -1 to +1. 
Formula to calculate Correlation:

Covariance: Covariance tells us the direction of the linear relationship between two random variables. It can take any value between - ∞ and + ∞.
Formula to calculate Covariance:

39. What are Support Vectors in SVM?
Support Vectors are data points that are nearest to the hyperplane. It influences the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Removing the support vectors will alter the position of the hyperplane. The support vectors help us build our support vector machine model.

40. What is Ensemble learning?
Ensemble learning is a combination of the results obtained from multiple machine learning models to increase the accuracy for improved decision-making. 
Example: A Random Forest with 100 trees can provide much better results than using just one decision tree.

41. What is Cross-Validation?
Cross-Validation in Machine Learning is a statistical resampling technique that uses different parts of the dataset to train and test a machine learning algorithm on different iterations. The aim of cross-validation is to test the model’s ability to predict a new set of data that was not used to train the model. Cross-validation avoids the overfitting of data.
K-Fold Cross Validation is the most popular resampling technique that divides the whole dataset into K sets of equal sizes.
42. What are the different methods to split a tree in a decision tree algorithm?
Variance: Splitting the nodes of a decision tree using the variance is done when the target variable is continuous.

Information Gain: Splitting the nodes of a decision tree using Information Gain is preferred when the target variable is categorical.

Gini Impurity: Splitting the nodes of a decision tree using Gini Impurity is followed when the target variable is categorical.

43. How does the Support Vector Machine algorithm handle self-learning? 
The SVM algorithm has a learning rate and expansion rate which takes care of self-learning. The learning rate compensates or penalizes the hyperplanes for making all the incorrect moves while the expansion rate handles finding the maximum separation area between different classes.
44. What are the assumptions you need to take before starting with linear regression?
There are primarily 5 assumptions for a Linear Regression model:

Multivariate normality
No auto-correlation
Homoscedasticity
Linear relationship
No or little multicollinearity

45. What is the difference between Lasso and Ridge regression?
Lasso(also known as L1) and Ridge(also known as L2) regression are two popular regularization techniques that are used to avoid overfitting of data. These methods are used to penalize the coefficients to find the optimum solution and reduce complexity. The Lasso regression works by penalizing the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. In Ridge or L2 regression, the penalty function is determined by the sum of the squares of the coefficients.

Interview_Questions,Top 40 Coding Interview Questions You Should Know,"understanding of the candidate.
1. What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a storage format that defines the way data is stored, organized, and manipulated.
Some popular data structures are Arrays, Trees, and Graphs.

2. What is an Array?

An array is commonly referred to as a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
Items stored are of the same type.
It organizes data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.


Fig: Array
3. What is a Linked List?

Like an array, a linked list refers to a linear data structure in which the elements are not necessarily stored in a contiguous manner.
It is basically a sequence of nodes, each node points towards the next node forming a chain-like structure.


Fig: Linked List
4. What is LIFO?

LIFO is an abbreviation for Last In First Out
It is a way of accessing, storing and retrieving data.
It extracts the data that was stored last first.

5. What is a Stack?

A stack refers to a linear data structure performing operations in a LIFO (Last In First Out) order.
In a stack, elements can only be accessed, starting from the topmost to the bottom element.

6. What is FIFO?

FIFO stands for First In First Out.
It is a way of accessing, storing and retrieving data.
The data that was stored first is extracted first.


Fig: LIFO, FIFO

7. What is a Queue?

A queue refers to a linear data structure that performs operations in a FIFO order.
In a queue, the least recently added elements are removed first as opposed to a stack. 


Fig: Queue
8. What are Binary Trees?

A binary tree is an extension of the linked list structure where each node has at most two children. 
A binary tree has two nodes at all times, a left node and a right node.


Fig: Binary Trees
9. What is Recursion?


Recursion refers to a function calling itself based on a terminating condition.
It uses LIFO and therefore makes use of the stack data structure.

The next couple of coding interview questions will explore your knowledge of OOPs.
10. What is the OOPs concept?
OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming System, a paradigm that provides concepts such as objects, classes, and inheritance.
11. What are the concepts introduced in OOPs?
Following are the concepts introduced in OOPs:

Object - A real-world entity having a particular state and behavior. We can define it as an instance of a class.
Class - A logical entity that defines the blueprint from which an object can be created or instantiated.
Inheritance - A concept that refers to an object gaining all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It provides code reusability.
Polymorphism - A concept that allows a task to be performed in different ways. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
Abstraction - A concept that hides the internal details of an application and only shows the functionality. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
Encapsulation - A concept that refers to the wrapping of code and data together into a single unit.

This is one of the very common coding interview questions, that often allows the interviewer to branch out into related topics based on the candidate’s answers
12. Explain what a Binary Search Tree is.

A binary search tree is used to store data in a manner that it can be retrieved very efficiently. 
The left sub-tree contains nodes whose keys are less than the node’s key value.
The right sub-tree contains nodes whose keys are greater than or equal to the node’s key value

Doubly linked lists are categorized as a special type of linked list in which traversal across the data elements can be done in both directions. 
This is made possible by the presence of two links in every node, one that links to the node next to it and another that connects to the node before it.


Fig: Doubly Linked List
14. What is a Graph?

A graph is a particular type of data structure that contains a set of ordered pairs.
The ordered pairs in a graph are also known as edges or arcs and are most commonly used to connect nodes where the data can be stored and retrieved.

15. Differentiate between linear and non-linear data structure?



Linear data structure


Non-linear data structure




It is a structure in which data elements are adjacent to each other


It is a structure in which each data element can connect to over two adjacent data elements




Examples of linear data structure include linked lists, arrays, queues, and stacks


Examples of nonlinear data structure include graphs and trees



16. What is a Deque?

A deque is a double-ended queue.
This is a structure in which elements can be inserted or removed from either end.

17. What’s the difference between Stack and Array?



Stack


Array




Stack follows a Last In First Out (LIFO) pattern. What this means is that data access necessarily follows a particular sequence where the last data to be stored is the first one that will be extracted.


On the other hand, Arrays do not follow a specific order, but instead can be accessed or called by referring to the indexed element within the array.

18. Which sorting algorithm is the best?

There are many types of sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort, balloon sort, merge sort, radix sort, and more.
No algorithm can be considered as the best or fastest because they have designed each for a specific type of data structure where it performs the best

19. How does variable declaration affect memory?

The amount of memory that is to be reserved or allocated depends on the data type being stored in that variable. 
For example, if a variable is declared to be “integer type”, 32 bits of memory storage will then be reserved for that particular variable.

20. What are dynamic data structures?
Dynamic data structures have the feature where they expand and contract as a program runs. It provides a very flexible method of data manipulation because adjusts based on the size of the data to be manipulated.
These 20 coding interview questions that test the conceptual understanding of the candidates give the interview a clear idea on how strong the candidate’s fundamentals are

The next set of coding interview questions focus tests the programming expertise of the candidates and dives deep into various related aspects.
The code screenshots given along with the below coding interview questions helps you provide the answer to the question, with clarity.
21. How do you reverse a string in Java?

Declare a string.
Take out the length of that string.
Loop through the characters of the string.
Add the characters in reverse order in the new string.

String str = ""hello"";

String reverse = """";

int length = str.length();

for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {

     reverse = str.charAt(i) + reverse;

}

System.out.println(reverse);

22. How do you determine if a string is a palindrome?

A string is a palindrome when it stays the same on reversing the order of characters in that string.
It can be achieved by reversing the original string first and then checking if the reversed string is equal to the original string.

if (str.equals(reverse)) {

    System.out.println(""Palindrome"");

} else {

    System.out.println(""Not Palindrome"");

}
Free Course: Programming FundamentalsLearn the Basics of ProgrammingEnroll Now23. Find the number of occurrences of a character in a String?
To find the number of occurrences, loop through the string and search for that character at every iteration; whenever it is found, it will update the count.
int count = 0;

char search = 'a';

for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {

    if (str.charAt(i) == search) {

        count++;

    }

}

System.out.println(count);
24. How to find out if the given two strings are anagrams or not?
Two strings are anagrams if they contain a similar group of characters in a varied sequence.

Declare a boolean variable that tells at the end of the two strings are anagrams or not.
First, check if the length of both strings is the same, if not, they cannot be anagrams.
Convert both the strings to character arrays and then sort them.
Check if the sorted arrays are equal. If they are equal, print anagrams, otherwise not anagrams. 

boolean anagrmstat = false;
if (str.length() != reverse.length()) {
    System.out.println(str + "" and "" + reverse + "" not anagrams string"");
} else {
    char[] anagram1 = str.toCharArray();
    char[] anagram2 = reverse.toCharArray();
    Arrays.sort(anagram1);
    Arrays.sort(anagram2);
    anagrmstat = Arrays.equals(anagram1, anagram2);
}
if (anagrmstat == true) {
    System.out.println("" anagrams string"");
} else {
    System.out.println("" not anagrams string"");
}
25. How do you calculate the number of vowels and consonants in a String?

Loop through the string.
Increase the vowel variable by one whenever the character is found to be a vowel, using the if condition. Otherwise, increment the consonant variable.
Print the values of both the vowel and the consonant count.

int vowels = 0;
int consonants = 0;
for (int k = 0; k < str.length(); k++) {
    char c = str.charAt(k);
    if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u')
        vowels++;
    else
        consonants++;
}
System.out.println(""Vowel count is "" + vowels);
System.out.println(""Consonant count is: "" + consonants);
26. How do you get the matching elements in an integer array?

Declare an array.
Nest a couple of loops to compare the numbers with other numbers in the array.
Print the matching elements if found.

int[] a = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7 };
for (int m = 0; m < a.length; m++) {
    for (int n = m + 1; n < a.length; n++) {
        if (a[m] == a[n])
            System.out.print(a[m]);
    }
}
27. How would you implement the bubble sort algorithm?

Declare an array.
Nest a couple of loops to compare the numbers in the array.
The array will be sorted in ascending order by replacing the elements if found in any other order.

int[] a = { 1, 2, 7, 6, 4, 9, 12 };
for (int k = 0; k < a.length; k++) {
    for (int l = 0; l < a.length - l - 1; l++) {
        if (a[l] > a[l + 1]) {
            int t = a[l];
            a[l] = a[l + 1];
            a[l + 1] = t;
        }
    }
}

28. How would you implement the insertion sort algorithm?

We assume the first element in the array to be sorted. The second element is stored separately in the key. This sorts the first two elements. You can then take the third element and do a comparison with the ones on the left of it. This process will go on until a point where we sort the array.

int[] a = { 1, 2, 7, 6, 4, 9, 12 };
for (int m = 1; m < a.length; m++) {
    int n = m;
    while (n > 0 && a[n - 1] > a[n]) {
        int k = a[n];
        a[n] = a[n - 1];
        a[n - 1] = k;
        n--;
    }
}
29. How do you reverse an array?

Loop till the half-length of the array.
Replace the numbers corresponding to the indexes from the starting and the end.

int[] a = { 1, 2, 7, 6, 4, 9, 12 };
for (int t = 0; t < a.length / 2; t++) { 
    int tmp = a[t]; 
    a[t] = a[a.length - t - 1]; 
    a[a.length - t- 1] = tmp;

Declare two variables and initialize them with values.
Make b the sum of both numbers.
Then subtract the sum (b) from a, so a is now swapped.
Lastly, subtract a from the sum (b), so b is also swapped.

int a = 10;
int b = 20;
b = b + a; // now b is sum of both the numbers
a = b - a; // b - a = (b + a) - a = b (a is swapped)
b = b - a; // (b + a) - b = a (b is swapped)
31. Print a Fibonacci series using recursion?

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

We can calculate them using the mathematical formula used in the Fibonacci recursive function.


public static int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
public static void main(String args[]) {
    int n = 10;
    System.out.println(fibonacci(n));
}
32. How do you find the factorial of an integer?

A factorial is a function that multiplies a number by every number below it. For example, 5!= 5*4*3*2*1=120.
Recursive function multiples the numbers until it reaches 1.

public static long factorial(long n) {
if (n == 1)
    return 1;
else
    return (n * factorial(n - 1));
}
33. How do you reverse a Linked List?

Declare a linked list.
Add elements to that linked list.
Apply the descending iterator method to the linked list.
This reverses the order of elements in the linked list.

LinkedList<Integer> ll = new LinkedList<>();
ll.add(1);
ll.add(2);
ll.add(3);
System.out.println(ll);
LinkedList<Integer> ll1 = new LinkedList<>();
ll.descendingIterator().forEachRemaining(ll1::add);
System.out.println(ll1);
FREE Java Certification TrainingLearn A-Z of Java like never beforeEnroll Now34. How would you implement Binary Search?

Binary search divides the array into half in every iteration step until it finds the element.
It works on the sorted arrays since it compares the values of adjacent elements and then calculates the mid number.
If the value of low becomes greater than high at any point, it means the element is not present in the list.

int mid = (low + high) / 2;
while (low <= high) {
    if (arr[mid] < key) {
        low = mid + 1;
    } else if (arr[mid] == key) {
        return mid;
    } else {
        high = mid - 1;
    }
    mid = (low + high) / 2;
}
if (low > high) {
    return -1;
}
return -1;
35. How would you find the second largest number in an array?

Loop through the array.
If the value of i is greater than the highest, store the value of i in highest, and store the value of highest in the second-highest variable.

private static int findSecondHighest(int[] array) {
    int highest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    int secondHighest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    for (int i : array) {
        if (i > highest) {
            secondHighest = highest;
            highest = i;
        } else if (i > secondHighest) {
            secondHighest = i;
        }
    }
    return secondHighest;
}
36. How do you remove all occurrences of a given character from the input string?

Use the built-in string method “replace” to replace a character with any other character, including symbols and white spaces.

String str1 = ""Australia"";
str1 = str1.replace(""a"", """");
System.out.println(str1); // ustrli
37. Showcase Inheritance with the help of a program?

The class Cat inherits the property color from the class Animal by extending the parent class (Animal).
This way a class Cat can have more parent classes if it wishes to inherit their properties.

class Animal {
    String color;
}
class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println(""Meow"");
    }
}
38. Explain overloading and overriding with the help of a program?
Overloading:
When a class has two or more methods with the same name, they are called overloaded methods.
class Foo {
    void print(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
    }
    void print(String s, int count) {
        while (count > 0) {
            System.out.println(s);
            count--;
        }
    }
}
Overriding:
When a superclass method is also implemented in the child class, it’s a case of overriding.
class Base {
    void printName() {
        System.out.println(""Base Class"");
    }
}
class Child extends Base {
    @Override
    void printName() {
        System.out.println(""Child Class"");
    }
}

Use if statements to check for each condition separately:

If the number is 0 or 1, it cannot be prime.
If the number is 2, it is prime number.
If the number is indivisible by other numbers, it is prime.


public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return false;
    }
    if (n == 2) {
        return true;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

40. How do you sum all the elements in an array?

Use for loop to iterate through the array and keep adding the elements in that array.

int[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
int sum = 0;
for (int i : array)
    sum += i;
System.out.println(sum);
