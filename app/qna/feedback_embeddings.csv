Interview_Answers,Interview Question: Tell Me About Yourself (With Answers),"﻿How to answer ""Tell me about yourself""
How you respond to ""Tell me about yourself"" may determine how successful the rest of your interview is. When you practice your answer, you want to tell a great story about yourself that you can share in two minutes or less. Follow these steps to prepare your response:




1. Mention experiences and successes as they relate to the job
Begin by reviewing the job description. Notice what skills the job requires and identify recent actions of yours that show them. You can review the STAR method to practice telling great stories in your interviews. You can refer to recent professional experience primarily, but you may also reflect on past volunteer work and other relevant experiences to support your narrative.


2. Consider how your current job relates to the job for which you're applying
You may discuss your current job and relate your experiences to the open role. If you're applying for a more senior role, explain how you're taking on more responsibilities in your current position. If you're making a lateral transition to a role with different skills, describe how your existing skills translate into the new position.


3. Focus on strengths and abilities supported with examples
When you start building the script of each example, focus on details and outcomes that you can quantify if possible. For example, imagine that you want to talk about how you improved the customer service that your place of employment offered in a past role. Instead of only stating that you improved customer service, you may strengthen your example by stating that you increased customer service response rates each quarter by 10% to 15%. If you don't have the exact information, estimate a realistic value.


4. Highlight your personality
Because ""Tell me about yourself"" is about getting to know you, it's a good idea to share your personality with your interviewer. You may want to briefly mention hobbies that show your intellectual development or highlight your community engagement. Some of these hobbies may include your love of reading, music, volunteering or playing a team sport. You may also discuss hobbies that show personal discipline and achievement like learning a new skill. Discussing personal interests is a good way to conclude your response while maintaining a professional tone.


5. Format your response
For your response to be clear and concise, you can ensure to organize your answer following a format or formula. There are two common formulas you may consider:


Present, past and future 
Past, present and future
Both of these formulas work for your response, but you may choose one based on the roles from your experience that are most relevant to the position you're seeking. For example, if your most recent role highlights many of the skills and qualifications required for the role you're seeking, you may want to begin with the present. However, if you're making a career transition and your past experience is more closely related to the role than your current position, you may want to begin with your past.


Example answers to ""Tell me about yourself""
Sometimes seeing an example can be helpful, though each person's ""tell me about yourself"" answer will be different. Below are a few short scripts showing how this question can highlight someone's strengths supported by successful results in less than two minutes:




Example 1
Here's an example response from a candidate who's applying to work in the health care industry:


""I began my career in retail management, but a few years ago, my professional interests shifted to the health care industry. I've always been skilled at bringing people together and working toward common goals. My experience successfully leading teams and managing stores led me to consider administration, and I've been building a career as a driven health administrator for the last four years. In my current role at XYZ Medical Center, the efficiency of the office has been a personal focus, especially concerning patient outcomes.


Last year, I worked with our IT department to implement a communication system for scheduling procedures to ensure that all departments had enough staff members. Our new online scheduling portal increased communication efficiency by 20%. To stay informed about their ongoing concerns, I hold regular meetings with various health care personnel. I've been enjoying that part of my work and I'm especially interested in bringing the experience I've gained to the team at ABC Health. Outside the office, I'm an avid reader and love to hike.""


Example 2
Here's an example answer from a candidate who's applying to work in the interior design industry:


""I've been passionate about design since I was a kid. My parents remodeled their house when I was in high school and allowed me to play an active role in the interior design plans. I knew then that I wanted to pursue interior design as my career. I studied interior design in college and graduated four years ago with my bachelor's degree. Since college, I've worked at an interior design firm in Savannah, Georgia. During my time there, I've been able to build my portfolio by designing both residential and commercial spaces.


My experience at the firm has built up my proficiencies in building and cutting-edge technologies and allowed me to build strong relationships with local suppliers. The most rewarding part of my job has been working in Savannah's historic buildings. This experience has familiarized me with the best-in-class building preservation methods. Moving forward, I would love to work at a design firm like this one that specializes in the design and preservation of historical buildings. I believe my experience and passion for preservation will allow me to be a great asset to your design team.""


Example 3
Here's an example answer from a candidate who's applying to work in the restaurant industry:


""Currently, I work at XYZ Restaurant as a hostess. I've been there for just over two years. My responsibilities include greeting and seating customers, assessing wait times, fulfilling to-go orders and answering the phones. I love the lively and busy environment of XYZ Restaurant, and it's helped me learn how to multitask and manage my time efficiently. Before working at XYZ Restaurant, I worked in retail as a floor associate for a year. This role helped me develop my customer service skills and become more comfortable in a team-oriented environment.


I'm looking to further develop my customer service and problem-solving skills as a hostess in a restaurant environment. I'm interested in your restaurant specifically as the employees have a great reputation for delivering first-in-class customer service while maintaining a lively and dynamic environment. Outside of work, I love baking and taking mixology classes with my friends. While I genuinely enjoy these activities, they also help me refine my professional skills.""",-0.09917299,0.15844686,0.22254296,-0.08309605,0.0004713459,0.113564186,-0.19315666,0.13002293,-0.1543542,0.103005946,0.05165905,-0.13645324,0.25236288,0.012057263,0.0689809,-0.2694279,0.20456961,0.09786531,-0.36915487,0.24213065,0.07212119,-0.10747545,0.16002187,-0.02716722,0.12673415,-0.14282104,-0.10579689,-0.4680231,0.04257341,-0.10799316,-0.1317323,0.53198916,-0.060044713,-0.0012111184,-0.04308313,0.2879873,-0.049019042,0.20926364,-0.0190983,-0.15611249,-0.30255437,-0.2511835,0.11122517,-0.2953192,-0.13289672,0.060843423,0.13006894,-0.32388917,-0.052204173,-0.7508763,0.037624206,-0.07025962,0.0871186,1.0522195,-0.12520343,-2.2564187,0.11714985,-0.27319846,1.5480844,0.39491755,-0.13979599,0.7368274,-0.19005767,0.070148565,0.70690054,0.00203279,0.39696422,0.25378543,0.24791001,-0.1418131,-0.018448878,-0.15565513,-0.07265683,-0.39924887,0.16814551,0.08363775,-0.13627774,-0.049700286,-0.7633585,-0.073882736,0.5152732,0.13175486,-0.3568492,0.10101031,-1.3476429,-0.12743044,0.09519348,-0.10429627,-0.22615153,-0.37417173,-0.06478974,-0.03798134,-0.02070751,0.047675025,-0.42914522,-0.03321259,-0.23104745,-0.34540442,0.5875137,0.2641902
Interview_Answers,10 Common Job Interview Questions and How to Answer Them,"﻿1. Could you tell me about yourself and describe your background in brief?
Interviewers like to hear stories about candidates. Make sure your story has a great beginning, a riveting middle, and an end that makes the interviewer root for you to win the job.


Talk about a relevant incident that made you keen on the profession you are pursuing and follow up by discussing your education. In the story, weave together how your academic training and your passion for the subject or industry the company specializes in, combined with your work experience, make you a great fit for the job. If you’ve managed a complex project or worked on an exciting, offbeat design, mention it.


Example: “I come from a small town, where opportunities were limited. Since good schools were a rarity, I started using online learning to stay up to date with the best. That’s where I learned to code and then I went on to get my certification as a computer programmer. After I got my first job as a front-end coder, I continued to invest time in mastering both front- and back-end languages, tools, and frameworks.”


2. How did you hear about this position?
Employers want to know whether you are actively seeking out their company, heard of the role from a recruiter, or were recommended to the position by a current employee. In short, they want to know how you got to them.


If someone recommended you for the position, be sure to say their name. Don’t assume that the interviewer already knows about the referral. You’ll probably want to also follow up with how you know the person who referred you. For example, if you and Steve (who recommended you) worked together previously, or if you met him over coffee at a networking event, mention it to give yourself a little more credibility. If Steve works at the company and suggested that you apply for the job, explain why he thought you’d be the perfect fit.


If you sought out the role yourself, be clear about what caught your eye — extra bonus points if you can align your values with the company and their mission. You want to convince the hiring manager that you chose their company, over all other companies, for a few specific reasons.


Lastly, if you were recruited, explain why you took the bait. Did this role sound like a good fit? Does it align with the direction you want to take your career? Even if you weren’t familiar with the organization prior to being recruited, be enthusiastic about what you’ve learned and honest about why you’re interested in moving forward with the process.


Example: “I learned about the position through LinkedIn as I’ve been following your company’s page for a while now. I’m really passionate about the work you’re doing in X, Y, and Z areas, so I was excited to apply. The required skills match well with the skills I have, and it seems like a great opportunity for me to contribute to your mission, as well as a great next move for my career.”


3. What type of work environment do you prefer?
Be sure to do your homework on the organization and its culture before the interview. Your research will save you here. Your preferred environment should closely align to the company’s workplace culture (and if it doesn’t, it may not be the right fit for you). For example, you may find on the company’s website that they have a flat organizational structure or that they prioritize collaboration and autonomy. Those are key words you can mention in your answer to this question.


If the interviewer tells you something about the company that you didn’t uncover in your research, like, “Our culture appears buttoned-up from the outside, but in reality, it’s a really laid-back community with little competition among employees,” try to describe an experience you’ve had that dovetails with that. Your goal is to share how your work ethic matches that of the organization’s.


Example: “That sounds great to me. I like fast-paced work environments because they make me feel like I’m always learning and growing, but I really thrive when I’m collaborating with team members and helping people reach a collective goal as opposed to competing. My last internship was at an organization with a similar culture, and I really enjoyed that balance.”


4. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?
The employer wants to know: Do you hold down the fort or crumble under pressure? They want to make sure that you won’t have a meltdown when the pressure becomes intense and deadlines are looming. The ability to stay calm under pressure is a highly prized talent.


Share an instance when you remained calm despite the turmoil. If it’s a skill you’re developing, acknowledge that and include the steps you’re taking to respond better to pressure in the future. For example, you could indicate that you’ve started a mindfulness practice to help you better deal with stress.


Example: “I realize stressful situation are always going to come up, and I definitely have had to learn how to navigate them throughout my career. I think I get better at it with every new experience. While working on a new product launch at my last company, for example, things were not going according to plan with my team. Instead of pointing fingers, my first reaction was to take a step back and figure out some strategies around how we could we solve the problem at hand. Previously, I may have defaulted to panicking in that situation, so being calm and collected was definitely a step forward and helped me approach the situation with more clarity.”




5. Do you prefer working independently or on a team?
Your answer should be informed by the research you’ve done on the company culture and the job in question. Nevertheless, you should expect that most work environments will have some team aspect.


Many positions require you to work collaboratively with other people on a daily basis, while some roles require you to work on your own. When you answer this question, highlight the best traits of your personality and how they fit the job requirements. It could also be in your interest to answer this question by highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of both situations.


Example: “I enjoy a blend of the two. I like having a team to strategize with, get diverse opinions from, and reach out to for feedback. But I am also comfortable taking on assignments that require me to work independently. I find I do some of my best work when I can focus alone in a quiet space, but I really value collaborating with my teammates to come up with the best ideas.”


6. When you’re balancing multiple projects, how do you keep yourself organized?
Employers want to understand how you use your time and energy to stay productive and efficient. They’re also looking to understand if you have your own system for staying on track with the work beyond the company’s schedules and workflow plans. Be sure to emphasize that you adhere to deadlines and take them seriously.


Discuss a specific instance when you stayed on track. Talk about the importance and urgency of the projects you were working on and how you allocated your time accordingly. Explain how you remain organized and focused on the job in front of you.


Example: “I’m used to juggling projects at my current job where I’m often moving between coding one software program to another. I use the timeboxing technique to make sure they’re all on track, allocating time on my calendar for certain tasks. I’ve found it really helps me prioritize what needs to get done first, and it holds me accountable for the more repetitive day-to-day tasks I’m responsible for.”


7. What did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?
This question may come up as a result of the pandemic. Employers want to know how people used their time differently. Know that you don’t have to feel scared about answering this question if you didn’t spend your time brushing up on skills or taking courses. We learn from any experience we have.


If you spent time honing your professional skills, you might say the following.


Example: “The extra time on my plate really allowed me to get introspective around where I want to take my career. I read a lot of journals to keep abreast of the latest ideas in my field, and sharpened my skills by taking some online courses, such as…” (and then be specific).


If you chose to work on your personal development, you could say something like the following.


Example: “Like everyone else, I, too, gained some time last year from not having to travel two hours a day to and from work. I decided to spend my time on things I love. So I got back to learning how to play the guitar and journaling. I feel it brought me closer to myself and has been really great for my mental health and productivity.”


8. What are your salary expectations?
Before you walk in for your first interview, you should already know what the salary is for the position you’re applying to. Check out websites such as Glassdoor, Fishbowl, or Vault.com for salary information. You could also ask people in the field by reaching out to your community on LinkedIn.


Employers will always ask this question because every position is budgeted, and they want to ensure your expectations are consistent with that budget before moving forward.


Remember that it’s often better to discuss a salary range rather than a specific number during the interview and leaving room for negotiation. It’s also better to err on the side of caution and quote a slightly higher number as it’s easier to negotiate downward than upward. As a general rule of thumb, I advise not bringing up the questions about salary until your interviewer does or bringing it up too early in the process.


Example: “Based on my skills and experience and on the current industry rates, I’m looking at a salary around $____” (then fill in with your desired salary range and rationale).


9. Are you applying for other jobs?
Interviewers want to know if you’re genuinely interested in this position or if it’s just one of your many options. Simply, they want to know if you’re their top choice. Honesty is the best policy. If you’re applying for other jobs, say so. You don’t have to necessarily say where you’re applying unless you have another offer. But they might want to know where in the hiring process you are with other companies. You can also mention that you’re actively looking for offers if your interviewer asks.


Example: “I’ve applied to a couple of other firms, but this role is really the one I’m most excited about right now because…”


10. From your resume it seems you took a gap year. Would you like to tell us why that was?
Gap years are more popular in some cultures than others. In some professions, gap years may have a negative connotation (the industry moves too fast and you’re not up to date).


Let your interviewer know that your gap year wasn’t about procrastinating over your transition from childhood to adulthood, but that it added value to the confident professional you have become. Based on what part of the world you’re in and how common these are, employers are likely looking to hear stories of what you did and how your experiences have benefitted and prepared you for this role.


Provide a short explanation of why you decided to pursue a gap year, then focus on what came out of it that made a positive difference for your future.


Example: “During my last year of high school, I didn’t feel ready to choose my educational path, so I took a wilderness course for a few months to sort out my life goals. It may seem a little random, but the time I spent actually helped my develop so many new skills — in the areas of leadership, communication, (etc…). During that time, I realized that I wanted to earn a degree in (state your degree) to align with my passion (say what that is).”",-0.11588807,0.2130332,0.32584628,-0.19190668,-0.09053569,0.16406685,-0.23241605,0.169738,-0.11688656,0.018669475,0.09544322,-0.027616942,0.24676889,-0.01508702,0.08652396,-0.28196537,0.17006806,0.11616534,-0.41136461,0.24030694,0.16228625,-0.05135365,0.15998034,-0.050927565,0.14991225,-0.09089035,-0.1469264,-0.5120995,0.093254365,-0.16660918,-0.12310036,0.53835624,-0.052806117,0.031832516,-0.01609142,0.30860776,-0.041739672,0.2231401,0.009402942,-0.18452142,-0.3682396,-0.22812738,0.092417665,-0.35928544,-0.21719642,0.03490067,0.15267035,-0.32545033,-0.07310947,-0.8175768,0.03271745,-0.046292637,0.099098206,1.094269,-0.1904227,-2.3310823,0.08641468,-0.24132386,1.5823469,0.45279196,-0.12790635,0.8028031,-0.27934414,0.070931464,0.75317603,0.03136384,0.46252087,0.3153652,0.15293615,-0.20253931,-0.008387736,-0.2503636,-0.08725348,-0.4227818,0.14309369,0.08936822,-0.17618202,-0.07136584,-0.74339813,-0.020177994,0.54523647,0.06903271,-0.4850327,0.07946916,-1.3977287,-0.17672265,0.11163055,-0.059596784,-0.24366777,-0.35857457,-0.10609963,-0.0640716,-0.08192573,-0.019033687,-0.4724164,-0.072950125,-0.22138312,-0.29744497,0.54855824,0.2795818
Interview_Answers,Common Interview Questions & Answers,"﻿Examples of Best Interview Answers for Questions About You:
Employers want to understand more about you and how you might fit into their organization.


1. Question: Tell me about yourself.
One of the most common questions in an interview is “Tell me about yourself.” Actually, it is not even a question — it is an invitation.
Your answer to this question is your opportunity to share with the interviewer whatever you think is important about you in their hiring decision.
More importantly, it is your chance to differentiate yourself from other candidates. In most cases, the standard questions offer the same opportunity.


2. Question: What do you want?
Don’t interpret this as a philosophical question about your plans for family, retirement, or dinner. The reality is that a potential employer is looking to see if your career aspirations and professional work satisfaction are achievable within their framework. If you want to be a CEO within five years, that may not be a good match for them.
Focus on them: With that in mind, you will want to know if this job and their organization are a good fit for you. So, instead, share the qualifications, experience, and desires you have that fit this opportunity. Make it clear that this job has all the elements you’re looking for in a role (know what these are).


3. Question: Where do you see yourself in five years?


Employers don’t necessarily care to hear that you expect to climb the corporate ladder and be a supervisor.
If the job you’re interviewing for is not a supervisor, they probably are not concerned about your management skills. You can share how you have been a mentor to others and led projects with little to no supervision. That should indicate you have leadership potential.


Focus on them: In five years, you should have made a significant impact to the company’s bottom line. Think about how you can achieve this in the role you are interviewing for. In technology careers, advancing your skills is important, too. You should be able to share what areas you want to strengthen in the near term (but be careful that they are not areas of expertise that the company needs now).


4. Question: Why should we hire YOU?


This is clearly a differentiation question. What you want to tell them is: they’d be crazy not to they hire you.


Focus on them: You need to only share how you meet almost all the criteria they seek, and also have two to three additional abilities that they might not even know they need…yet. They need to know you are a candidate who can not only meet their needs now, but will also be valuable for where they want to go in the future.


Are they likely to need another skill set as they grow as a company?
Or maybe you have skills that you noticed are in another job description they are looking to fill?


You can help out with those deliverables until they find someone (or be a backup to the person they hire).


Have you been down a path already that they are currently starting? Having “lessons learned” to offer them is a very strong plus for a job candidate.


5. Question: Why do you want THIS job?


There should be a heartfelt answer on this one. Your gut should be giving you the answer.


Although, if the reason is about money, location, work schedule, benefits, and other factors not tied to actual role, you may want to think a little more about your answer. None of those reasons are important to the hiring manager.


Focus on them: They want to hear that this job is exactly what you’ve been thinking about as a next step in your career.


Of course, the follow-up question they’ll ask is: How so?


Be prepared to answer with your rationale for how this job meets your professional needs and how you can contribute at your highest potential while in this role. People want to feel like their work means something. There is nothing wrong with sharing that feeling in a thoughtful way.




6. Question: How do people describe you?


Here’s another opportunity to differentiate yourself. Everyone claims to be: a hard worker, good communicator, and team player.


But how many are a: problem-solver, game-changer, leader in the industry?


Be creative, and have stories to back it up. The interviewer will want to know why someone thinks you are one of these things.


Focus on them: You want to present attributes that make you sound like the go-to guy or gal wherever you work. Even the standard answers can be taken a step further to be more valuable:


Yes, they want hard workers, but most likely that’s commonplace at their office. Maybe you work hard, but also help others work fewer hours (by helping them do their job better or making their jobs easier).
Good communicators are everywhere. But this does not mean just speaking well. It includes active listening. Do you hear things that others don’t? Do you understand things quickly? Can you figure out what people are trying to tell you through other clues (body language, for example)?
Being a good team player is expected, too. But what does this really mean? Getting along with everyone? That’s not hard to do if you’re a nice person. Pulling your weight in the office? Again, expected. What have you done, beyond your job description, that saved the team from a disaster or helped them make an impossible deadline? Have you won an award for this?
7. Question: What is your greatest weakness?


I hate the “greatest weakness” question. Everyone knows it’s a trap, and everyone knows the candidate is going to say something trite (popular example: “I’m a perfectionist”).


Focus on them: Don’t pick a weakness that will disqualify you for the job, but do give a real answer.


When you give a real answer, you are being genuine. You are admitting you have some growth opportunities and are not perfect. But you can include that you already have a plan to overcome this weakness through training or practice (or have already started down this road).


Some people even insert a little humor in their answer—“I wish I was better at tennis.” You can, too, if you feel like the interviewer has a sense of humor. But, be sure to quickly follow with a serious answer. Showing you have a lighter side is usually a good thing.




8. Question: What is your greatest strength?


Your greatest strength is something they actually need.


Don’t choose something irrelevant to the job or the employer, like your skill in Sudoku (unless Sudoku expertise is a requirement for this job).
Focus on them: You have many strengths, but pick the one they need help with the most. Is it your expertise in a particular skill or technology? Is it your ability to turn low-performing teams into high performers? Share something that makes them think they need to hire you…right now.


If they often outsource or hire consultants in a key area of your expertise, you’re in their sweet spot for candidates.




9. Question: What is your greatest accomplishment (or achievement)?


Consider this question an invitation to do some bragging about what you have achieved in your career that can benefit this new employer. By asking this question, the interviewers are inviting you to share an achievement/accomplishment which provides proof that you are the best candidate for this job


Focus on them: Choose a recent accomplishment, if possible, that demonstrates your ability to do this job very well. Have several good examples prepared before the interview.


Like your greatest strength, your greatest accomplishment aligns with something they need. Again, as with strengths, while you have many accomplishments you could describe, the smartest strategy is to focus on your recent accomplishments that make it clear you can do their job very well.


Be truthful and also be very careful about treating this question casually. Advanced preparation is the smartest strategy.


Hopefully, your LinkedIn Profile and your resume reference this accomplishment or situation in some way.




10. Question: Why do you want to leave your current job?


This can be a deal-breaker question.
Obviously, if you say you hate your current boss or company, the interviewer will naturally believe you will hate them eventually. And, if you say, your current compensation or role is below your standards, they will again assume the worst.


Although these may be legitimate reasons to leave a job, there must be other reasons, too.


Your current company or department may have become unstable (hopefully the interviewer’s company is very stable).
Your current employer may not be able to offer you any professional growth (the interviewer’s should be able to do this).


Do you see a pattern here? Highlight a reason that the hiring manager cannot be concerned about.


Of course, if you have an issue that is very important to you that could be a deal-breaker (like company culture), you can mention it. Just be prepared for them to take one extreme or the other. For example, maybe you only want to work for companies that buy from vendors in your home country. The hiring manager will let you know if their company does this. And if they don’t, I guess the interview is over.
11. Question: Do YOU have any questions?


My simple advice is: yes, you had better have questions.


When I hired people to work on my teams in the past, I expected interviewees to have questions.


This is your chance to “interview the interviewer.” In essence, to learn about the company, the role, the corporate culture, the manager’s leadership style, and a host of other important things.


Candidates who are genuinely interested in the opportunity, ask these types of questions. Those who don’t ask questions give the impression they’re “just kicking the tires” or not really too concerned about getting the job.


It is imperative that you ask questions that do three things:
Show you did some research about the company.
Mention something else (related, but interesting) about you.
Will have an interesting answer or prompt a good discussion.


12. Question: When can you start?


Be careful about this question for several reasons:


It doesn’t mean that you have “landed the job.” They may be just checking to add that to their notes. You must keep your guard up until you are in your car and driving away from the interview.


If you are currently employed, you should be honest about the start date and show professionalism. You should tell them you would have to discuss a transition with your current company to see if they require a 2 week notice (or some other timing). If you currently have a critical role, your potential new employer would expect a transition period.


If you can start right away (and they know you are not currently employed), you certainly can say you’re able to start tomorrow. Sense of urgency and excitement about starting work at the new company is always a good thing.




Best Interview Answers for Salary Questions:
These are scary questions that need to be answered carefully. Your answers will likely impact any job offer you may receive.


13. Question: What is your current salary?


This question is illegal for an employer to ask in many locations in the USA.
In addition, asking for your current salary is inappropriate because that salary is being paid by a different employer for a different job (even if the job titles are the same) in a different environment (maybe even different geography, industry, or size of company).
If this question is legal in the employer’s location, and even if it is not legal, be prepared to answer. You can probably dodge the question for a while by offering your salary expectations (see below) for the job and/or asking for the typical salary band for this role in their company.




14. Question: What are your salary expectations?


This question is the start of the salary negotiation, in case they decide to make you an offer (unfortunately an offer is not guaranteed just because they ask).


Reality is that salary is on part of the employer’s “compensation package” which may include other items of very high value, like bonuses, tuition reimbursement, healthcare, paid vacation, and other benefits.


Be prepared by researching what most employers in your location pay for this type of job; if you can, find out what this employer pays for the job. Conduct your research on sites like PayScale, Salary.com, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and Google.


When you do answer, provide a salary range rather than a specific number, and indicate that it is variable depending on the benefits they offer. Be sure you are comfortable with a salary at the bottom of this range.




Best Interview Answers for Questions About Them:
15. Question: Why do you want to work here?
This is a key indicator of how interested you really are in the employer and the job. The answer to this question has two aspects:


The content
Your delivery


Focus on them:


Content — Employers want to know you feel you can fit in at the company quickly. That means not only deliverables in the job description, but also your fit with the company culture. You will likely have to do some homework to answer this one. You need to understand the reasons why others enjoy working there. Is it a great place to advance your skills, have great challenges to add to your resume, or will it allow you to grow as a professional?
Delivery — The delivery must be genuine. If a hiring manager feels you’re just “telling them want they want to hear,” but don’t mean it…well, the interview is over in their mind. They want to know this is not just a job and paycheck. They want to hear this is what you want to do and the best place to do it.




16. Question: What do you know about us?


This is actually a test. If you know very little, it is an indication that you are not very serious about working there.


Focus on them: Candidates who are really excited about the prospect of working there have done their homework. If you really want to stand out, learn more than what is listed on their web site.


Do some heavy research — perhaps find some articles on the company that not many would know about. It may even come up in conversation spontaneously, and you can show them a copy of the article (I have had this happen to me).


17. Question: How did you find this job?


You may have found the opportunity through research on ideal jobs where you can make the most impact and hope to grow professionally.


I would also hope you looked for companies that you feel meet your standards for corporate culture, investment in employees, successful business model (or perhaps giving back to community), and any other aspects you feel are important to you.


Make sure you can go into a little detail on what you found in your research.


The “job” may have found you. In that case, you can say you were contacted by HR or a recruiter who felt you were a good fit. But don’t leave it there.


You should still mention you did your homework and verified that this is right for you — as a potential contributor to the company’s success, and as a good match for what you’re looking for in an employer.




Best Interview Answers About Special Career Situations:
18. Question: Why did you quit your last job?


This is a tough one. Typically, you should not quit a job until you have accepted another job.


However, life doesn’t always allow that to happen. Did you quit because you couldn’t spend enough time looking for your next job? Perhaps the company you worked for was close to shutting down and you didn’t want to waste valuable time waiting for the last day of operation.


Certainly, there are common reasons that are understood as necessity:


Had to move to a new location for various reasons.
Family or health reasons.
Unbearable work conditions (careful here, as already discussed).


The key to answering this question is to keep it short. Don’t feel the need to expand your answer to include a lot of details.




19. Question: Why were you fired?


This is another danger zone. This is not the time for defending yourself with a long story about you being the victim.


If you made a mistake, you are going to have to try to minimize the severity of the situation.


An argument with a boss could be described as a difference in opinion. Not following orders because your moral compass told you not to could be described as “taking the high road.”


Just be careful not to cast blame on others. Consider including a “silver lining.” Did you learn a lot from the experience and now possess knowledge that will mitigate the chances of this happening again?




Laid off is not fired: If you were part of a layoff, this is different from being fired. It was likely a financial decision by management, and you were part of a group that was targeted as part of budget cuts. Layoffs are typically not personal — they are just business. Hiring managers know this (and likely have been involved in one at some point in their careers).




20. Question: Why were you laid off?


Be very careful with this question. It sounds like an invitation to complain about your previous employer. Interviews are a bad time to trash anyone — even the previous employer who eliminated your job.
Let the interviewer decide on their own (if they care) about how badly management performed. Just make a simple statement about the cause of the layoff (as it was explained to you upon exit), and then quickly follow with a question about the stability of their company and history with layoffs.






21. Question: How do you explain your gap in employment?


Hiring managers don’t want to hear that you felt it was time for a “long-awaited break from the rat-race.” Or “time to recharge your batteries.” The first thought that will pop into their heads: When is your next break coming? Probably in the middle of a big project we’re working on.",-0.14258306,0.24374704,0.37904638,-0.2582838,-0.118351914,0.14549139,-0.21751545,0.19247213,-0.07027783,-0.014082703,0.06725204,0.008169432,0.28247488,-0.00659864,0.082764626,-0.3020555,0.18720916,0.16548526,-0.39147604,0.29897413,0.16514629,-0.06356698,0.14086232,-0.053910557,0.12912102,-0.0991381,-0.12637612,-0.52162635,0.07115506,-0.19453071,-0.08249978,0.54437476,-0.049887594,0.018271547,0.06382359,0.32524252,-0.035654012,0.23785207,0.041942377,-0.194571,-0.36383787,-0.1993076,0.11403112,-0.40801135,-0.16898517,0.026759015,0.21618985,-0.33025706,-0.14379285,-0.8534326,0.075748675,-0.101749524,0.11151237,1.094628,-0.20031647,-2.3769097,0.0858664,-0.26522925,1.6386288,0.46341476,-0.15254954,0.8014662,-0.30306062,0.055401642,0.84721255,0.02634502,0.49226925,0.35345802,0.11367397,-0.26096532,-0.016396029,-0.30245063,-0.10908284,-0.41394955,0.17393798,0.053835016,-0.14641742,-0.07208956,-0.80538577,-0.013057141,0.56604886,0.016554506,-0.53515464,0.036206774,-1.4603523,-0.22469409,0.13879153,-0.06725267,-0.19638382,-0.38476515,-0.11939171,-0.06927603,-0.07991747,-0.057912655,-0.48619968,-0.05408517,-0.18992746,-0.34840643,0.56564814,0.2915172
Interview_Answers,10 Common Interview Questions and How to Answer Them,"﻿1. Tell me about yourself. 
This warm-up question is your chance to make an impactful first impression. Be prepared to describe yourself in a few sentences. You can mention: 


Your past experiences and how they relate to the current job


How your most recent job is tied to this new opportunity


Two of your strengths


One personal attribute, like a hobby or an interest


The majority of this response leans on your past work experience, with a small dash of your personal life added at the end of the response. Keep your answer to two to four minutes.


2. Why do you want to work for this company?
The answer to this interview question should include specifics about the company, so you’ll need to do some pre-interview research. If, for example, the company is known for its collaborative culture, you could point out successes you’ve had while collaborating with a team. 


Look for company-specific information on their website and social channels. Pay attention to the company’s mission statement, values, and the ‘About us’ section. Explore employee-specific posts on social media to learn about the company’s culture or outreach programs. Combine this information with relatable skills to show your preparedness and enthusiasm for the company. 


3. Why are you leaving your current role?
When asked about leaving a previous job, be honest but positive. Even if you left a job under trying circumstances, keep your response short and upbeat. Here are some suggestions:


I’m looking for a company that better aligns with my values. 


I’m excited to find a company where I can grow my career. 


I’ve decided to go down a different career path.


My position was downsized, but I’m looking forward to a new opportunity. 


I’m excited to explore a culture in line with my personality. 


I’m ready to take on a new challenge with an innovative company. 


I’ve aspired to work for this company and seized the chance to apply.




4. What is your biggest weakness?
When it comes to identifying weaknesses, think about some conflicts you’ve had to overcome. Maybe it’s difficult for you to take criticism, collaborate, or make public presentations. Take these challenges and frame them with a solution. For instance, you learned to take feedback to better a project, collaborate to elevate a product’s offerings, or use presentations as a way to build your confidence. 




5. What do you consider your greatest achievement?
Your greatest achievement should be something specific, like bringing a new video game to a saturated market despite a lack of resources. Discuss a work-related triumph as a way to humbly mention your achievements as opposed to listing awards or accolades. This achievement should also fall in line with the company’s mission, goals, or the position’s objectives.


6. Tell me about a difficult situation you’ve faced and how you handled it. 
This question is really asking about your character during moments of stress. Think of a time when you faced an impossible deadline, had to choose sides, or navigated interoffice turmoil. Explain the problem, how you stayed calm, and focus on the solution that produced a resolution. 


7. Give an example of how you’ve gone above and beyond your role requirements. 
While you might be tempted to mention the extra hours you put in or the additional tasks you take on, it’s best to showcase your skills with a story. Talk about the innovative methods you deployed to revive a stalled project or roles you filled when your team was downsized.   


8. What are your salary expectations?
Salary talks can be sensitive, but they’re necessary. Research a competitive salary before you go into your interview, so you don’t aim too high or low. You can use tools like a Salary Calculator or Salary Comparison and Estimator to get baseline compensation. Be sure to mention years of experience or specific certifications that enhance your value.   


9. Where do you see yourself five years from now? 
Another common interview question looks at your five-year plan. You should promote your commitment to the company while looking toward growth opportunities.  


More specifically, you can craft a response that explores your:


Position-related goals


Potential experiences within the company over the next five years


Possible certifications, skills, or achievements you might obtain

Interview_Answers,Your 2023 Guide to the Most Common Interview Questions and Answers,"﻿1. Tell me about yourself.
This question seems simple, so many people fail to prepare for it, but it’s crucial. Here's the deal: Don’t give your complete employment (or personal) history. Instead, give a pitch—one that’s concise and compelling and that shows exactly why you’re the right fit for the job. Muse writer and MIT career counselor Lily Zhang recommends using a present, past, future formula. Talk a little bit about your current role (including the scope and perhaps one big accomplishment), then give some background as to how you got there and experience you have that’s relevant. Finally, segue into why you want—and would be perfect for—this role.


Possible answer to “Tell me about yourself.”
“Well, I’m currently an account executive at Smith, where I handle our top-performing client. Before that, I worked at an agency where I was on three different major national healthcare brands. And while I really enjoyed the work that I did, I’d love the chance to dig in much deeper with one specific healthcare company, which is why I’m so excited about this opportunity with Metro Health Center.”






2. Walk me through your resume.
Like “Tell me about yourself,” this question is a common interview opener. But instead of framing your answer around what qualities and skills make you best for the position, your answer should group your qualifications by your past jobs and tell your career story. You might choose to tell this story chronologically, especially if there’s a great anecdote about what set you on this path. Or, as with “Tell me about yourself,” you can begin with your present job then talk about what brought you here and where you’re going next. But regardless, when you speak about your “past” and “present,” highlight your most relevant experiences and accomplishments for this job and wrap up by talking about the future, i.e. connect your past and present together to show why this job should be the next one you add to your resume.


Possible answer to “Walk me through your resume.”
“Well, as you can see from my resume, I took a bit of a winding road to get to where I am today. In college, I double majored in chemistry and communications. I found early on that working in a lab all day wasn’t for me and at some point I realized I looked forward to the lab class I TA’ed the most.


“So when I graduated, I found a job in sales for a consumer healthcare products company, where I drew on my teaching experience and learned even more about tailoring your message and explaining complex health concepts to people without a science background. Then, I moved into a sales training role at a massive company where I was responsible for teaching recent graduates the basics of selling. My trainees on average had more deals closed in their first quarter than any of the other trainers’ cohorts. Plus, I got so much satisfaction from finding the right way to train each new hire and watching them progress and succeed. It reminded me of my time as a TA in college. That’s when I started taking night classes to earn my chemistry teaching certificate.


“I left my full-time job last year to complete my student teaching at P.S. 118 in Manhattan, and over the summer, I worked for a science camp, teaching kids from the ages of 10 to 12 about basic chemistry concepts and best practices for safe experiments. Now, I’m excited to find my first full-time teaching job, and your district is my top choice. The low student-to-teacher ratio will let me take the time to teach each student in the best way for them—which is my favorite part of the job.”






3. How did you hear about this position?
Another seemingly innocuous interview question, this is actually a perfect opportunity to stand out and show your passion for and connection to the company. For example, if you found out about the gig through a friend or professional contact, name-drop that person, then share why you were so excited about the job. If you discovered the company through an event or article, share that. Even if you found the listing through a random job board, share what, specifically, caught your eye about the role.


Possible answer to “How did you hear about this position?”
 “I heard about an opening on the product team through a friend of a friend, Akiko, and since I’m a big fan of your work and have been following you for a while I decided it would be a great role for me to apply for.”




4. Why do you want to work at this company?
Beware of generic answers! If what you say can apply to a whole slew of other companies, or if your response makes you sound like every other candidate, you’re missing an opportunity to stand out. Zhang recommends one of four strategies: Do your research and point to something that makes the company unique that really appeals to you; talk about how you’ve watched the company grow and change since you first heard of it; focus on the organization’s opportunities for future growth and how you can contribute to it; or share what’s gotten you excited from your interactions with employees so far. Whichever route you choose, make sure to be specific. And if you can’t figure out why you’d want to work at the company you’re interviewing with by the time you’re well into the hiring process? It might be a red flag telling you that this position is not the right fit.


Possible answer to “Why do you want to work at this company?”
“I saw on The Muse that you were also hiring for new positions on the West Coast to support your new operations there. I did some more reading about the new data center you’re building there and that excites me as I know this means there’ll be opportunities to train new teammates. I also learned through a Wall Street Journal article that you’re expanding in Mexico as well. I speak Spanish fluently and would be eager to step up and help liaise whenever necessary.”






5. Why do you want this job?
Again, companies want to hire people who are passionate about the job, so you should have a great answer about why you want the position. (And if you don’t? You probably should apply elsewhere.) First, identify a couple of key factors that make the role a great fit for you (e.g., “I love customer support because I love the constant human interaction and the satisfaction that comes from helping someone solve a problem”), then share why you love the company (e.g., “I’ve always been passionate about education, and I think you’re doing great things, so I want to be a part of it”).


Possible answer to “Why do you want this job?”
“I’ve always been a fan of X Co’s products and I’ve spent countless hours playing your games. I know that your focus on unique stories is what drew me and other fans into your games initially and keeps us coming back for more. I’ve followed X Co on social media for a while, and I’ve always loved how you have people in different departments interact with users. So I was psyched when I came across this posting for a social media manager with TikTok experience. At my last job, I was responsible for launching our TikTok account and growing it to 10,000 followers in six months. Between that experience, my love of gaming, and my deep knowledge of your games and fanbase, I know I could make this TikTok account something special and exciting.”




6. Why should we hire you?
This interview question seems forward (not to mention intimidating!), but if you’re asked it, you’re in luck: There’s no better setup for you to sell yourself and your skills to the hiring manager. Your job here is to craft an answer that covers three things: that you can not only do the work, but also deliver great results; that you’ll really fit in with the team and culture; and that you’d be a better hire than any of the other candidates.


Possible answer to “Why should we hire you?”
“I know it’s been an exciting time for General Tech—growing so much and acquiring several startups—but I also know from experience that it can be challenging for the sales team to understand how new products fit in with the existing ones. It’s always easier to sell the product you know, so the newer stuff can get shortchanged, which can have company-wide ramifications. I have over a decade of experience as a sales trainer, but more importantly, most of those years were working with sales teams that were in the exact same boat Gen Tech is in now. Growth is wonderful, but only if the rest of the company can keep up. I’m confident I can make sure your sales team is confident and enthusiastic about selling new products by implementing an ongoing sales training curriculum that emphasizes where they sit in a product lineup.”




7. What can you bring to the company?
When interviewers ask this question, they don’t just want to hear about your background. They want to see that you understand what problems and challenges they’re facing as a company or department as well as how you’ll fit into the existing organization. Read the job description closely, do your research on the company, and make sure you pay attention in your early round interviews to understand any issues you’re being hired to solve. Then, the key is to connect your skills and experiences to what the company needs and share an example that shows how you’ve done similar or transferable work in the past.


Possible answer to “What can you bring to the company?”
“As Jocelyn talked about in our interview earlier, PopCo is looking to expand its market to small business owners with less than 25 employees, so I’d bring my expertise in this area and my experience in guiding a sales team that’s selling to these customers for the first time. In most of my past roles, this segment has been my focus and in my current role, I also played a big part in creating our sales strategies when the business began selling to these customers. I worked with my managers to develop the sales script. I also listened in on a number of sales calls with other account execs who were selling to these customers for the first time and gave them pointers and other feedback. In the first quarter, our 10-person sales team closed 50 new bookings in this segment, and I personally closed 10 of those deals. I helped guide my last company through the expansion into small businesses, and I’m eager to do that again at PopCo. Plus, I noticed you have a monthly karaoke night—so I’m eager to bring my rendition of ‘Call Me Maybe’ to the team as well.”






8. What are your greatest strengths?
Here’s an opening to talk about something that makes you great—and a great fit for this role. When you’re answering this question, think quality, not quantity. In other words, don’t rattle off a list of adjectives. Instead, pick one or a few (depending on the question) specific qualities that are relevant to this position and illustrate them with examples. Stories are always more memorable than generalizations. And if there’s something you were hoping to mention because it makes you a great candidate, but you haven’t had a chance yet, this would be the perfect time.


Possible answer to “What are your greatest strengths?”
“I’d say one of my greatest strengths is bringing organization to hectic environments and implementing processes to make everyone’s lives easier. In my current role as an executive assistant to a CEO, I created new processes for pretty much everything, from scheduling meetings to planning monthly all hands agendas to preparing for event appearances. Everyone in the company knew how things worked and how long they would take, and the structures helped alleviate stress and set expectations on all sides. I’d be excited to bring that same approach to an operations manager role at a startup, where everything is new and constantly growing and could use just the right amount of structure to keep things running smoothly.”






9. What do you consider to be your weaknesses?
What your interviewer is really trying to do with this question—beyond identifying any major red flags—is to gauge your self-awareness and honesty. So, “I can’t meet a deadline to save my life” is not an option—but neither is “Nothing! I’m perfect!” Strike a balance by thinking of something that you struggle with but that you’re working to improve. For example, maybe you’ve never been strong at public speaking, but you’ve recently volunteered to run meetings to help you get more comfortable when addressing a crowd.


Possible answer to “What do you consider to be your weaknesses?”
“It can be difficult for me to gauge when the people I’m working with are overwhelmed or dissatisfied with their workloads. To ensure that I’m not asking too much or too little from my team, we have weekly check-ins. I like to ask if they feel like they’re on top of their workload, how I could better support them, whether there’s anything they’d like to take on or get rid of, and if they’re engaged by what they’re doing. Even if the answer is ‘all good,’ these meetings really lay the groundwork for a good and trusting relationship.”






10. What is your greatest professional achievement?
Nothing says “hire me” better than a track record of achieving amazing results in past jobs, so don’t be shy when answering this interview question! A great way to do so is by using the STAR method: situation, task, action, results. Set up the situation and the task that you were required to complete to provide the interviewer with background context (e.g., “In my last job as a junior analyst, it was my role to manage the invoicing process”), then describe what you did (the action) and what you achieved (the result): “In one month, I streamlined the process, which saved my group 10 person-hours each month and reduced errors on invoices by 25%.”


Possible answer to “What is your greatest professional achievement?”
“My greatest accomplishment was when I helped the street lighting company I worked for convince the small town of Bend, Oregon to convert antiquated street lighting to energy-efficient LED bulbs. My role was created to promote and sell the energy-efficient bulbs, while touting the long-term advantage of reduced energy costs. I had to develop a way to educate city light officials on the value of our energy-efficient bulbs—which was a challenge since our products had an expensive up-front cost compared to less efficient lighting options. I created an information packet and held local community events aimed at city officials and the tax-paying public. There, I was able to demo the company product, answer questions, and evangelize the value of LED bulbs for the long term. It was crucial to have the public on board and I was able to reach a wide variety of community members with these events. I not only reached my first-year sales goal of $100,000, but I was also able to help us land another contract in a neighboring city. Plus, the community-focused strategy garnered attention from the national media. And I’m proud to say I got a promotion within one year to senior sales representative.”






11. Tell me about a challenge or conflict you’ve faced at work, and how you dealt with it.
You’re probably not eager to talk about conflicts you’ve had at work during a job interview. But if you’re asked directly, don’t pretend you’ve never had one. Be honest about a difficult situation you’ve faced (but without going into the kind of detail you’d share venting to a friend). “Most people who ask are only looking for evidence that you’re willing to face these kinds of issues head-on and make a sincere attempt at coming to a resolution,” former recruiter Richard Moy says. Stay calm and professional as you tell the story (and answer any follow-up questions), spend more time talking about the resolution than the conflict, and mention what you’d do differently next time to show “you’re open to learning from tough experiences.”


Possible answer to “Tell me about a challenge or conflict you’ve faced at work, and how you dealt with it.”
“Funnily enough, last year I was part of a committee that put together a training on conflict intervention in the workplace and the amount of pushback we got for requiring attendance really put our training to the test. There was one senior staff member in particular who seemed adamant. It took some careful listening to understand he felt like it wasn’t the best use of his time given the workload he was juggling. I made sure to acknowledge his concern. And then I focused on his direct objection and explained how the training was meant to improve not just the culture of the company, but also the efficiency at which we operated—and that the goal was for the training to make everyone’s workload feel lighter. He did eventually attend and was there when I talked to the whole staff about identifying the root issue of a conflict and addressing that directly without bringing in other issues, which is how I aim to handle any disagreement in the workplace.”




12. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership skills.
You don’t have to have a fancy title to act like a leader or demonstrate leadership skills. Think about a time when you headed up a project, took the initiative to propose an alternate process, or helped motivate your team to get something done. Then use the STAR method to tell your interviewer a story, giving enough detail to paint a picture (but not so much that you start rambling) and making sure you spell out the result. In other words, be clear about why you’re telling this particular story and connect all the dots for the interviewer.


Possible answer to “Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership skills.”
“I think that a good leader is someone who can make decisions while also listening to others and being willing to admit when you’re wrong and course correct. In my last role, my team and I were responsible for giving a big presentation to a prospective client. I quickly assigned different tasks to members of my team, but the project never really got moving. I gave everyone an opportunity to share their input and concerns, and it turned out that they were struggling in the roles I’d given them. I ended up switching a few people around. Meanwhile, the employee I’d assigned to give the presentation was nervous, but still wanted to give it a try. I worked with them to make sure they were ready and even held a practice session so that they could rehearse in a more comfortable environment. When the time came for the real thing, they nailed it! We landed the client and the company still has the account to this day. And that employee became a go-to person for important client presentations. I’m really glad I took the time to listen to everyone’s concerns so that I could re-evaluate my approach and help my team be the best it could be.”






13. What’s a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?
The ideal anecdote here is one where you handled a disagreement professionally and learned something from the experience. Zhang recommends paying particular attention to how you start and end your response. To open, make a short statement to frame the rest of your answer, one that nods at the ultimate takeaway or the reason you’re telling this story. For example: “I learned early on in my professional career that it’s fine to disagree if you can back up your hunches with data.” And to close strong, you can either give a one-sentence summary of your answer (“In short…”) or talk briefly about how what you learned or gained from this experience would help you in the role you’re interviewing for.


Possible answer to “What’s a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?”
“In my job as a finance assistant, I was in charge of putting together reports for potential company investments. It was important to get the details and numbers right so that leaders had the best information to make a decision. One time, my boss asked me to generate a new report on a Wednesday morning and wanted it done by Thursday at 5 PM. Because I’m committed to high-quality work and I wasn’t sure my boss fully understood what goes into each report, I knew I needed to speak up. At her next available opening, I sat down with my boss and explained my concerns. She was firm that the report would be completed by Thursday at 5 PM. So I decided to ask if there was anyone who could help out. After thinking about it, my boss found another assistant who could put in a few hours. While it was a tight timeline, we got the report done, and the committee was really pleased to review it at the meeting. My boss appreciated my extra efforts to make it happen and I felt good that I hadn’t let the quality of the report slip. It was a good experience of being a team player but also knowing when and how to ask for help. And once I explained how much time and work goes into each report, my boss was careful to assign them further in advance.”






14. Tell me about a time you made a mistake.
You’re probably not too eager to dig into past blunders when you’re trying to impress an interviewer and land a job. But talking about a mistake and winning someone over aren’t mutually exclusive, Moy says. In fact, if you do it right, it can help you. The key is to be honest without placing blame on other people, then explain what you learned from your mistake and what actions you took to ensure it didn’t happen again. At the end of the day, employers are looking for folks who are self-aware, can take feedback, and care about doing better.


Possible answer to “Tell me about a time you made a mistake.”
“Early in my career, I missed a deadline that ended up costing us a really big account. There were a lot of factors that contributed to this, but ultimately, I was the one who dropped the ball. From that experience, I went back and thought really hard about what I could’ve controlled and what I would’ve changed. It turns out that I was not nearly as organized as I thought I was. I sat down with my boss, asked for suggestions on how to improve my organizational skills, and a few months later I was able to score an even bigger account for the department.”






15. Tell me about a time you failed.
This question is very similar to the one about making a mistake, and you should approach your answer in much the same way. Make sure you pick a real, actual failure you can speak honestly about. Start by making it clear to the interviewer how you define failure. For instance: “As a manager, I consider it a failure whenever I’m caught by surprise. I strive to know what’s going on with my team and their work.” Then situate your story in relation to that definition and explain what happened. Finally, don’t forget to share what you learned. It’s OK to fail—everyone does sometimes—but it’s important to show that you took something from the experience.


Possible answer to “Tell me about a time you failed.”
“As a team manager, I consider it a failure if I don’t know what’s going on with my staff and their work—basically if a problem catches me by surprise then I’ve failed somewhere along the way. Even if the outcome is ultimately fine, it means I’ve left a team member unsupported at some point. A somewhat recent example would be this training we do every year for new project managers. Because it’s an event that my team has run so many times, I didn’t think to check in and had no idea a scheduling conflict was brewing into a full-on turf war with another team. The resolution actually ended up being a quick and easy conversation at the leadership team meeting, but had I just asked about it sooner it would never have been a problem to begin with. I definitely learned my lesson about setting reminders to check in about major projects or events even if they’ve been done dozens of times before.”




16. Why are you leaving your current job?
This is a toughie, but one you can be sure you’ll be asked. Definitely keep things positive—you have nothing to gain by being negative about your current employer. Instead, frame things in a way that shows that you’re eager to take on new opportunities and that the role you’re interviewing for is a better fit for you. For example, “I’d really love to be part of product development from beginning to end, and I know I’d have that opportunity here.” And if you were let go from your most recent job? Keep it simple: “Unfortunately, I was let go,” is a totally acceptable answer.


Possible answer to “Why are you leaving your current job?”
“I’m ready for the next challenge in my career. I loved the people I worked with and the projects I worked on, but at some point I realized I wasn’t being challenged the way I used to be. Rather than let myself get too comfortable, I decided to pursue a position where I can continue to grow.”




17. Why were you fired?
Of course, they may ask the follow-up question: Why were you let go? If you lost your job due to layoffs, you can simply say, “The company [reorganized/merged/was acquired] and unfortunately my [position/department] was eliminated.” But what if you were fired for performance reasons? Your best bet is to be honest (the job-seeking world is small, after all). But it doesn’t have to be a deal breaker. Frame it as a learning experience: Share how you’ve grown and how you approach your job and life now as a result. And if you can portray your growth as an advantage for this next job, even better.


Possible answer to “Why were you fired?”
“After working for XYZ Inc. for four years, there were some changes made to the amount of client calls we were expected to process per hour. I used the techniques we were taught after the change took effect, but didn’t want our customer service to slip. Unfortunately, I wasn’t consistently completing the required number of calls, and, as a result, I was let go. I felt really bad about this and in retrospect I could have done better sticking to the process that would have let me meet the per hour quota. But you’ve told me about the customer service standards and the volume expectations here, and I believe it won’t be a problem.”


18. Why was there a gap in your employment?
Maybe you were taking care of children or aging parents, dealing with health issues, or traveling the world. Maybe it just took you a long time to land the right job. Whatever the reason, you should be prepared to discuss the gap (or gaps) on your resume. Seriously, practice saying your answer out loud. The key is to be honest, though that doesn’t mean you have to share more details than you’re comfortable with. If there are skills or qualities you honed or gained in your time away from the workforce—whether through volunteer work, running a home, or responding to a personal crisis—you can also talk about how those would help you excel in this role.


Possible answer to “Why was there a gap in your employment?”
“I spent a number of years working at a company in a very demanding job, in which—as you’ll see from my references—I was very successful. But I’d reached a stage in my career where I wanted to focus on my personal growth. The time I spent traveling taught me a lot about how to get along with people of all ages and cultures. Now I feel more than ready to jump back into my career with renewed energy and focus and I feel this role is the ideal way to do that.”




19. Can you explain why you changed career paths?
Don’t be thrown off by this question—just take a deep breath and explain to the hiring manager why you’ve made the career decisions you have. More importantly, give a few examples of how your past experience is transferable to the new role. This doesn’t have to be a direct connection; in fact, it’s often more impressive when a candidate can show how seemingly irrelevant experience is very relevant to the role.


Possible answer to “Can you explain why you changed career paths?”
“Ever since my brother was diagnosed with a heart condition, I’ve been training and running with him in your annual Heart Run to raise money for your organization and help support patients with expenses not covered by insurance. Each time, I’ve been struck by how truly dedicated and happy to be there your employees have been. So when I saw this posting for a fundraising role, it felt like it was meant to be. For the last 10 years of my career I’ve been an account executive for various SaaS companies, and I’ve really honed my skills when it comes to convincing organizations to make regular payments for something over the long-term. But I’ve been looking for a position in fundraising where I can use these skills to really help people and I’m highly motivated to do that with your organization.”






20. What’s your current salary?
It’s now illegal for some or all employers to ask you about your salary history in several cities and states, including New York City; Louisville, North Carolina; California; and Massachusetts. But no matter where you live, it can be stressful to hear this question. Don’t panic—there are several possible strategies you can turn to. For example, you can deflect the question, Muse career coach Emily Liou says, with a response like: “Before discussing any salary, I’d really like to learn more about what this role entails. I’ve done a lot of research on [Company] and I am certain if it’s the right fit, we’ll be able to agree on a number that’s fair and competitive to both parties.” You can also reframe the question around your salary expectations or requirements (see question 38) or choose to share the number if you think it will work in your favor.


Possible answer to “What’s your current salary?”
“Before discussing any salary, I’d really like to learn more about what this role entails. I’ve done a lot of research on [Company] and I am certain if it’s the right fit, we’ll be able to agree on a number that’s fair and competitive to both parties.”




21. What do you like least about your job?
Tread carefully here! The last thing you want to do is let your answer devolve into a rant about how terrible your current company is or how much you hate your boss or that one coworker. The easiest way to handle this question with poise is to focus on an opportunity the role you’re interviewing for offers that your current job doesn’t. You can keep the conversation positive and emphasize why you’re so excited about the job.


Possible answer to “What do you like least about your job?”
“In my current role, I’m responsible for drafting media lists to pitch. While I’ve developed a knack for this and can do it when it is necessary, I’m looking forward to a job that allows me to have a more hands-on role in working with media partners. That’s one of the things that most excited me about your account supervisor position.”






22. What are you looking for in a new position?
Hint: Ideally the same things that this position has to offer. Be specific.


Possible answer to “What are you looking for in a new position?”
“I’ve been honing my data analysis skills for a few years now and, first and foremost, I’m looking for a position where I can continue to exercise those skills. Another thing that’s important to me is the chance to present my findings and suggestions directly to clients. I’m always very motivated by being able to see the impact of my work on other people. And I’m definitely looking for a position where I can grow since I hope to take on managerial responsibilities in the future. To sum it up, I’d love a position where I can use my skills to make an impact that I can see with my own eyes. Of course, the position is only part of the equation. Being at a company where I can grow and work toward something I care about matters, too. DNF’s goal of being at the intersection between data and education inspires me, and I’m really excited about this opportunity.”




23. What type of work environment do you prefer?
Hint: Ideally one that's similar to the environment of the company you're applying to. Be specific.


Possible answer to “What type of work environment do you prefer?”
“I really like the environment in my current position. My manager is a great resource and always willing to help out when I run into an issue, but they trust me to get my work done so I have a lot of freedom in how I schedule and prioritize, which is very important to me. Everyone has their own cubicle, so it’s often pretty quiet to get our work done, but we all get lunch together and our team has a lot of check-in meetings and communicates frequently via Slack so we still get a lot of opportunities to bounce ideas off each other. So I like both individual and more collaborative work. How would you describe the mix here?”




24. What’s your work style?
When an interviewer asks you about your work style, they’re probably trying to imagine you in the role. How will you approach your work? What will it be like to work with you? Will you mesh well with the existing team? You can help them along by choosing to focus on something that’s important to you and aligns with everything you’ve learned about the role, team, and company so far. The question is broad, which means you have a lot of flexibility in how you answer: You might talk about how you communicate and collaborate on cross-functional projects, what kind of remote work setup allows you to be most productive, or how you approach leading a team and managing direct reports. Just try to keep it positive. And remember, telling a story will almost always make your answer more memorable. 


Possible answer to “What’s your work style?”
“I tend to do my best work when I’m collaborating with colleagues and we’re working together toward a common goal. I was that rare student who loved group projects and now I still get a rush of excitement when I’m planning marketing campaigns with a team and bringing new and different voices into the fold. When I was working at XYZ Agency, I made it a habit to extend invitations to folks in different departments to join certain brainstorming and feedback sessions. Some of our most successful campaigns grew out of the ideas we generated together with coworkers in IT, HR, product, and customer success. That’s why I was so excited to learn that this role would have me working closely with the product and sales teams as well as with a talented marketing team. The other thing I find is crucial to making these collaborations successful is organization and documentation, so I’m also really big on creating one central home for all materials related to a project, including meeting notes, action items, drafts of campaign copy and visuals, and timelines.”


25. What’s your management style?
The best managers are strong but flexible, and that’s exactly what you want to show off in your answer. (Think something like, “While every situation and every team member requires a bit of a different strategy, I tend to approach my employee relationships as a coach...”) Then share a couple of your best managerial moments, like when you grew your team from five to 15 or coached an underperforming employee to become the company’s top salesperson.


Possible answer to “What’s your management style?”
“Management style is so hard to put your finger on, but I think in general a good manager gives clear directions and actually stays pretty hands-off, but is ready and available to jump in to offer guidance, expertise, and help when needed. I try my best to make that my management style. I also go out of my way to make sure I know when my team needs help. That means plenty of informal check-ins, both on the work they’re doing and on their general job satisfaction and mental well-being. I remember one project in particular at my most recent position that involved everyone working on a separate aspect of the product. This meant a lot of independent work for my team of seven people, but rather than bog everyone down with repetitive meetings to update me and everyone else on progress made, I created a project wiki that allowed us to communicate new information when necessary without disrupting another team member’s work. I then made it my job to make sure no one was ever stuck on a problem too long without a sounding board. Ultimately, despite the disparate project responsibilities, we ended up with a very cohesive product and, more importantly, a team that wasn’t burnt out.”


26. How would your boss and coworkers describe you?
First, be honest (remember, if you make it to the final round, the hiring manager will be calling your former bosses and coworkers for references!). Then try to pull out strengths and traits you haven’t discussed in other aspects of the interview, such as your strong work ethic or your willingness to pitch in on other projects when needed.


Possible answer to “How would your boss and coworkers describe you?”
“Actually, in my most recent performance review in April, my direct supervisor described me as someone who takes initiative and doesn’t shy away from hard problems. My role involves a lot of on-site implementation, and when things go wrong, it’s usually up to me to fix it. Rather than punting the problem back to the team, I always try to do what I can first. I know she appreciates that about me.”






27. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?
Here’s another question you may feel the urge to sidestep in an effort to prove you’re the perfect candidate who can handle anything. But it’s important not to dismiss this one (i.e. don’t say, “I just put my head down and push through it,” or, “I don’t get stressed out”). Instead, talk about your go-to strategies for dealing with stress (whether it’s meditating for 10 minutes every day or making sure you go for a run or keeping a super-detailed to-do list) and how you communicate and otherwise proactively try to mitigate pressure. If you can give a real example of a stressful situation you navigated successfully, all the better.


Possible answer to “How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?”
“I stay motivated by thinking about the end result. I’ve found that even in the midst of a challenging situation, reminding myself of my goals helps me take a step back and stay positive.”






28. What do you like to do outside of work?
Interviewers will sometimes ask about your hobbies or interests outside of work in order to get to know you a little better—to find out what you’re passionate about and devote time to during your off-hours. It’s another chance to let your personality shine. Be honest, but keep it professional and be mindful of answers that might make it sound like you’re going to spend all your time focusing on something other than the job you’re applying for.


Possible answer to “What do you like to do outside of work?”
“I’m a huge foodie. My friends and I love trying new restaurants in town as soon as they open—the more unusual the better! I love discovering new foods and cuisines, and it’s also a great activity to share with friends. I try to go out with the same group at least once a week and it’s a fun way to make sure we keep in touch and share experiences even when we’re busy with other things. We even took a trip to New York City and spent each day in a different neighborhood, buying something to share from a few restaurants.”






29. Are you planning on having children?
Questions about your family status, gender (“How would you handle managing a team of all men?”), nationality (“Where were you born?”), religion, or age are illegal—but they still get asked (and frequently). Of course, not always with ill intent—the interviewer might just be trying to make conversation and might not realize these are off-limits—but you should definitely tie any questions about your personal life (or anything else you think might be inappropriate) back to the job at hand. 


Possible answer to “Are you planning on having children?”
“You know, I’m not quite there yet. But I am very interested in the career paths at your company. Can you tell me more about that?”




30. How do you stay organized?
Would you want to work with a hot mess? Yeah, we didn’t think so. Neither does anyone else. A disorganized worker doesn’t just struggle in their own role, they can also create chaos for peers, managers, direct reports, clients, customers, and anyone else they interact with. So interviewers will often ask about how you keep yourself organized to make sure you’d be able to handle the workload and gauge what you’d be like to work with. In your answer, you’ll want to reassure them you’d have things under control (both in what you say and how you say it), describe a specific system or method you’ve used (bonus points if you can tie it to the role you’re interviewing for), and explain how it benefited you and your team. Just make sure your answer is succinct and, well, organized.


Possible answer to “How do you stay organized?”
“I take pride in my ability to stay organized, and it’s really come in handy in my past roles and especially the social media assistant job I’m in now. First, I keep a really meticulous calendar for each of the platforms I’m responsible for using Hootsuite—which I noticed you use here as well—and I try to block off time twice a week to get ahead on creating and slotting in posts. 


“Second, I’m a big fan of Trello, where I have one personal board I use as a to-do list color-coded by type of task and marked with priority level and one shared marketing team board that we use to coordinate campaigns launching across social, email, and other channels. We pay very close attention to the news in case we need to pause a campaign. If needed, I’d tag all the relevant stakeholders on Trello, immediately suspend all scheduled content in Hootsuite, and start a discussion on Slack or suggest a meeting to reassess strategy.


“Finally, I created a shared folder on Google Drive with subfolders by campaign that I update with one-pagers on goals and strategies, assets, a record of the actual posts deployed, performance analyses, and retros. That way, there’s a go-to place for anyone on the team to refer back to past projects, which I’ve found really helps us learn from every campaign and incorporate those learnings into what we’re working on next.”






31. How do you prioritize your work?
Your interviewers want to know that you can manage your time, exercise judgement, communicate, and shift gears when needed. Start by talking about whatever system you’ve found works for you to plan your day or week, whether it’s a to-do list app you swear by or a color-coded spreadsheet. This is one where you’ll definitely want to lean on a real-life example. So go on to describe how you’ve reacted to a last-minute request or another unexpected shift in priorities in the past, incorporating how you evaluated and decided what to do and how you communicated with your manager and/or teammates about it.


Possible answer to “How do you prioritize your work?”
“I’d be lost without my daily to-do list! At the beginning of each workday, I write out tasks to complete, and list them from highest to lowest priority to help keep me on track. But I also realize priorities change unexpectedly. On one particular day recently, I had planned to spend most of my time making phone calls to advertising agencies to get price quotes for an upcoming campaign. Then I did a quick check-in with my manager. She mentioned she needed help putting together a presentation ASAP for a major potential client. I moved the more flexible task to the end of the week and spent the next few hours updating the time-sensitive presentation. I make it a point to keep lines of communication open with my manager and coworkers. If I’m working on a task that will take a while to complete, I try to give a heads-up to my team as soon as possible. If my workload gets to be unmanageable, I check in with my boss about which items can drop to the bottom of the priority list, and then I try to reset expectations about different deadlines.”




32. What are you passionate about?
You’re not a robot programmed to do your work and then power down. You’re a human, and if someone asks you this question in an interview, it’s probably because they want to get to know you better. The answer can align directly with the type of work you’d be doing in that role—like if, for example, you’re applying to be a graphic designer and spend all of your free time creating illustrations and data visualizations to post on Instagram.


But don’t be afraid to talk about a hobby that’s different from your day-to-day work. Bonus points if you can “take it one step further and connect how your passion would make you an excellent candidate for the role you are applying for,” says Muse career coach Al Dea. Like if you’re a software developer who loves to bake, you might talk about how the ability to be both creative and precise informs your approach to code.


Possible answer to “What are you passionate about?”
“One of my favorite pastimes is knitting—I love being able to create something beautiful from nothing. Of course, knitting also requires a keen attention to detail and a lot of patience. Luckily, as an accountant I have cultivated both of those qualities!”






33. What motivates you?
Before you panic about answering what feels like a probing existential question, consider that the interviewer wants to make sure you’re excited about this role at this company, and that you’ll be motivated to succeed if they pick you. So think back to what has energized you in previous roles and pinpoint what made your eyes light up when you read this job description. Pick one thing, make sure it’s relevant to the role and company you’re interviewing for, and try to weave in a story to help illustrate your point. If you’re honest, which you should be, your enthusiasm will be palpable.


Possible answer to “What motivates you?”
“I’m driven primarily by my desire to learn new things—big or small—and take on new responsibilities so that I’m constantly growing as an employee and contributing more to my team and organization. I spent several summers working as a camp counselor and felt most fulfilled when I volunteered to lead planning for a talent show, jumped in to help with scheduling logistics, and learned how to run pickups efficiently. All of that experience helped immensely when I took a step up to become the lead counselor last year focused on operations, and that’s what excites me so much about the opportunity to take on this managerial role for the after-school program.”






34. What are your pet peeves?
Here’s another one that feels like a minefield. But it’ll be easier to navigate if you know why an interviewer is asking it. Most likely, they want to make sure you’ll thrive at their company—and get a glimpse of how you deal with conflict. So be certain you pick something that doesn’t contradict the culture and environment at this organization while still being honest. Then explain why and what you’ve done to address it in the past, doing your best to stay calm and composed. Since there’s no need to dwell on something that annoys you, you can keep this response short and sweet.


Possible answer to “What are your pet peeves?”
“It bothers me when an office’s schedule is really disorganized, because in my experience, disorganization can cause confusion, which can hurt the motivation of the team. As a person who likes things to be orderly, I try to help keep my team on task while also allowing for flexibility.”






35. How do you like to be managed?
This is another one of those questions that’s about finding the right fit—both from the company’s perspective and your own. Think back on what worked well for you in the past and what didn’t. What did previous bosses do that motivated you and helped you succeed and grow? Pick one or two things to focus on and always articulate them with a positive framing (even if your preference comes from an experience where your manager behaved in the opposite way, phrase it as what you would want a manager to do). If you can give a positive example from a great boss, it’ll make your answer even stronger.


Possible answer to “How do you like to be managed?”
“I enjoy having my hands in a lot of different projects, so I like working with managers who allow their employees to experiment, be independent, and work cross-functionally with other teams. At the same time, I really welcome it when a boss provides me with support, guidance, and coaching. No one can do anything alone, and I believe when managers and employees collaborate together and learn from one another everyone comes out on top.”




36. Do you consider yourself successful?
This question might make you uncomfortable. But you can think of it as an opportunity to allow the interviewer to get to know you better and to position yourself as an excellent choice for this job. First off, make sure you say yes! Then pick one specific professional achievement you’re proud of that can be tied back to the role you’re interviewing for—one that demonstrates a quality, skill, or experience that would help you excel in this position. You’ll want to explain why you consider it a success, talk about the process in addition to the outcome, and highlight your own accomplishment without forgetting your team. Zooming in on one story will help if you feel awkward tooting your own horn!


Possible answer to “Do you consider yourself successful?”
“I do consider myself successful, even though I’m early in my professional career. I took a full load of classes in my junior year of college because I wanted to take that summer to volunteer for a human rights organization overseas. I knew that I needed to make sure I was on track with my major, minor, and graduation requirements. It was difficult to juggle it all with my part-time job, which I kept to help account for the fact that I wouldn’t be earning money over the summer, and there were a few sleepless nights. But it was worth the hard work: I ended the year with a 3.9 GPA and the opportunity to volunteer for the agency in Ghana without falling behind my graduation timeline. For me success is about setting a goal and sticking with it, no matter how hard it is, and this experience was proof that I could be successful even when there’s a lot to balance, which I know there always is at a nonprofit like this one.”






37. Where do you see yourself in five years?
If asked this question, be honest and specific about your future goals, but consider this: A hiring manager wants to know a) if you've set realistic expectations for your career, b) if you have ambition (a.k.a., this interview isn't the first time you’re considering the question), and c) if the position aligns with your goals and growth. Your best bet is to think realistically about where this position could take you and answer along those lines. And if the position isn’t necessarily a one-way ticket to your aspirations? It’s OK to say that you’re not quite sure what the future holds, but that you see this experience playing an important role in helping you make that decision.


Possible answer to “Where do you see yourself in five years?”
“In five years, I’d like to be in a position where I know more about my longer-term career aspirations as a designer. I will have gotten experience working for a design agency and know more about the industry overall. I’ll have grown my technical skills and learned how to take feedback from clients and incorporate it. And the way your agency is set up, I’ll also have gotten the opportunity to design different kinds of deliverables—including websites, branding, and ad campaigns—for different kinds of clients to see where I really feel at home before settling on a focus.”
38. How do you plan to achieve your career goals?
Having goals shows interviewers you care, are ambitious, and can think ahead. Having a plan for how you’ll achieve your goals demonstrates your self-motivation as well as organizational and time management skills. Finally, the fact that you’ve accomplished past goals you’ve set for yourself is proof of your ability to follow through. All together, these are indications that you can not only set and achieve goals of your own, but also help your prospective boss, team, and company do the same. To craft your answer, make sure you focus on one or two goals in detail, explain why the goals are meaningful, communicate what milestones are coming up, highlight past successes, and connect back to this job. 


Possible answer to “How do you plan to achieve your career goals?”
“My current goal is to earn the CPA license so that I’m fully certified and prepared to contribute in a junior staff accounting job. My undergraduate degree is in finance and I completed an accounting internship with XYZ Company last summer. While I was there, I decided that each week I’d ask one person from a different team to coffee to learn about their job and career path. Not only did those conversations impress upon me the importance of getting my CPA as soon as possible, they also helped me realize I was eager to pursue forensic accounting, which is why I’m so excited about the opportunity to join this team. In order to ensure I earn my CPA this year, I enrolled in NASBA workshops, created a study schedule to keep myself on track, and will be taking my first trial test in three weeks. I plan on taking the actual test within the next three to six months.”




39. What are your career aspirations?
Career aspirations are bigger and loftier than career goals. With this question, interviewers are asking: What kind of career would make you happiest (while also being realistic)? Your aspirations might revolve around what kind of company you’d like to work for, what tasks you’d like to do, who you’d like to help, or how you’d like to be seen by your colleagues. So to answer this question, talk about what would energize and fulfill you and connect it to the position you’re interviewing for. Be specific about how this job will help you achieve your career aspirations.


Possible answer to “What are your career aspirations?”
“After growing up in a food desert, my biggest professional aspiration is to help make healthy food more widely available and accessible regardless of where you live. I also love solving complex problems. Currently, as a project manager, I specialize in strategic planning and combine it with a natural ability to engage critical stakeholders—resulting in on-time and under-budget delivery. This role would help me use those skills to work on a mission I’m passionate about. I am determined to use these skills to help your organization guarantee our community has access to affordable, nutritious food and information to make healthy decisions. In the next five or so years, I would love to take on additional responsibility and be in a decision-making role to drive the mission beyond our community and support even more families in gaining access to nutritious food options.”






40. What’s your dream job?
Along similar lines, the interviewer wants to uncover whether this position is really in line with your ultimate career goals. While “an NBA star” might get you a few laughs, a better bet is to talk about your goals and ambitions—and why this job will get you closer to them.






41. What other companies are you interviewing with?
Companies might ask you who else you’re interviewing with for a few reasons. Maybe they want to see how serious you are about this role and team (or even this field) or they’re trying to find out who they’re competing with to hire you. On one hand, you want to express your enthusiasm for this job, but at the same time, you don’t want to give the company any more leverage than it already has by telling them there’s no one else in the running. Depending on where you are in your search, you can talk about applying to or interviewing for a few roles that have XYZ in common—then mention how and why this role seems like a particularly good fit.


Possible answer to “What other companies are you interviewing with?”
“I’m interviewing with a few companies for a range of positions, but they all come down to delivering an excellent customer experience. I wanted to keep an open mind about how to best achieve that goal, but so far it seems that this role will really allow me to focus all of my energy on customer experience and retention, which I find very appealing.”


42. What makes you unique?
“They genuinely want to know the answer,” Dea promises. Give them a reason to pick you over other similar candidates. The key is to keep your answer relevant to the role you’re applying to. So the fact that you can run a six-minute mile or crush a trivia challenge might not help you get the job (but hey, it depends on the job!). Use this opportunity to tell them something that would give you an edge over your competition for this position. To figure out what that is, you can ask some former colleagues, think back to patterns you’ve seen in feedback you get, or try to distill why people tend to turn to you. Focus on one or two things and don’t forget to back up whatever you say with evidence.


Possible answer to “What makes you unique?”
“I basically taught myself animation from scratch. I was immediately drawn to it in college, and with the limited resources available to me, I decided to take matters into my own hands—and that’s the approach I take in all aspects of my work as a video editor. I don’t just wait around for things to happen, and when I can, I’m always eager to step in and take on new projects, pick up new skills, or brainstorm new ideas.”




43. What should I know that’s not on your resume?
It’s a good sign if a recruiter or hiring manager is interested in more than just what’s on your resume. It probably means they looked at your resume, think you might be a good fit for the role, and want to know more about you. To make this wide-open question a little more manageable, try talking about a positive trait, a story or detail that reveals a little more about you and your experience, or a mission or goal that makes you excited about this role or company.


Possible answer to “What should I know that’s not on your resume?”
“Well, one thing you won’t find on my resume: the time I had to administer emergency CPR. Last year, I was at the lake when I saw a young girl who looked like she was drowning. I was a lifeguard in high school, so I swam out, brought her to shore, and gave her CPR. Although this was—hopefully—a one-time event, I’ve always been able to stay calm during stressful situations, figure out a solution, and then act. As your account manager, I’d use this trait to quickly and effectively resolve issues both within the team and externally. After all, obstacles are inevitable, especially in a startup environment. And if anyone needs CPR at the office beach party, well, I’m your woman.”




44. What would your first few months look like in this role?
Your potential future boss (or whoever else has asked you this question) wants to know that you’ve done your research, given some thought to how you’d get started, and would be able to take initiative if hired. (In some interviews, you might even get the more specific, “What would your first 30, 60, or 90 days look like in this role?”) So think about what information and aspects of the company and team you’d need to familiarize yourself with and which colleagues you’d want to sit down and talk to. You can also suggest one possible starter project to show you’d be ready to hit the ground running and contribute early on. This won’t necessarily be the thing you do first if you do get the job, but a good answer shows that you’re thoughtful and that you care.


Possible answer to “What would your first few months look like in this role?”
“It’s been exciting to hear about some of the new initiatives the company has started in our previous conversations—like the database project and the company-wide sync, but I know there’s still a lot for me to learn. The first thing I’d do is line up meetings with the stakeholders involved in the projects I’d be tackling to help me figure out what I don’t know and then go from there. Hopping into a database project halfway through can be tricky, but I’m confident that once I know what all the stakeholders are looking for, I’ll be able to efficiently plot out our next steps and set appropriate deadlines. From there, I’ll be focused on hitting the milestones that I’ve set for the team.”






45. What are your salary expectations?
The number one rule of answering this question is: Figure out your salary requirements ahead of time. Do your research on what similar roles pay by using sites like PayScale and reaching out to your network. Be sure to take your experience, education, skills, and personal needs into account, too! From there, Muse career coach Jennifer Fink suggests choosing from one of three strategies:


Give a salary range: But keep the bottom of your stated range toward the mid-to-high point of what you’re actually hoping for, Fink says.
Flip the question: Try something like “That's a great question—it would be helpful if you could share what the range is for this role,” Fink says.
Delay answering: Tell your interviewer that you’d like to learn more about the role or the rest of the compensation package before discussing pay.
(And here’s some more info on responding to a question about your salary requirements on an application form.)


Possible answer to “What are your salary expectations?”
“Taking into account my experience and Excel certifications, which you mentioned earlier would be very helpful to the team, I’m looking for somewhere between $42,000 and $46,000 annually for this role. But for me, benefits definitely matter as well. Your free on-site gym, the commuter benefits, and other perks could definitely allow me to be a bit flexible with salary.”






46. What do you think we could do better or differently?
This question can really do a number on you. How do you give a meaty answer without insulting the company or, worse, the person you’re speaking with? Well first, take a deep breath. Then start your response with something positive about the company or specific product you’ve been asked to discuss. When you’re ready to give your constructive feedback, give some background on the perspective you’re bringing to the table and explain why you’d make the change you’re suggesting (ideally based on some past experience or other evidence). And if you end with a question, you can show them you’re curious about the company or product and open to other points of view. Try: “Did you consider that approach here? I’d love to know more about your process.”






47. When can you start?
Your goal here should be to set realistic expectations that will work for both you and the company. What exactly that sounds like will depend on your specific situation. If you’re ready to start immediately—if you’re unemployed, for example—you could offer to start within the week. But if you need to give notice to your current employer, don’t be afraid to say so; people will understand and respect that you plan to wrap things up right. It’s also legitimate to want to take a break between jobs, though you might want to say you have “previously scheduled commitments to attend to” and try to be flexible if they really need someone to start a bit sooner.


Possible answer to “When can you start?”
“I am excited for the opportunity to join your team. I have several projects to wrap up in my current role at [Company]. I plan to give them two weeks’ notice to make a smooth transition for my coworkers and will be happy to come onboard with the team here after that time.”






48. Are you willing to relocate?
While this may sound like a simple yes-or-no question, it’s often a little bit more complicated than that. The simplest scenario is one where you’re totally open to moving and would be willing to do so for this opportunity. But if the answer is no, or at least not right now, you can reiterate your enthusiasm for the role, briefly explain why you can’t move at this time, and offer an alternative, like working remotely or out of a local office. Sometimes it’s not as clear-cut, and that’s OK. You can say you prefer to stay put for xyz reasons, but would be willing to consider relocating for the right opportunity.


Possible answer to “Are you willing to relocate?”
“I do love living in Raleigh and would prefer to stay here. However, for the right opportunity I’d be willing to consider relocating if necessary.”




49. How many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?
1,000? 10,000? 100,000? Seriously? Well, seriously, you might get asked brain-teaser questions like these, especially in quantitative jobs. But remember that the interviewer doesn’t necessarily want an exact number—they want to make sure that you understand what’s being asked of you, and that you can set into motion a systematic and logical way to respond. So take a deep breath and start thinking through the math. (Yes, it’s OK to ask for a pen and paper!)




50. If you were an animal, which one would you want to be?
Seemingly random personality-test type questions like these come up in interviews because hiring managers want to see how you can think on your feet. There’s no wrong answer here, but you’ll immediately gain bonus points if your answer helps you share your strengths or personality or connect with the hiring manager. Pro tip: Come up with a stalling tactic to buy yourself some thinking time, such as saying, “Now, that is a great question. I think I would have to say…”






51. Sell me this pen.
If you’re interviewing for a sales job, your interviewer might put you on the spot to sell them a pen sitting on the table, or a legal pad, or a water bottle, or just something. The main thing they’re testing you for? How you handle a high-pressure situation. So try to stay calm and confident and use your body language—making eye contact, sitting up straight, and more—to convey that you can handle this. Make sure you listen, understand your “customer’s” needs, get specific about the item’s features and benefits, and end strong—as though you were truly closing a deal.






52. Is there anything else you’d like us to know?
Just when you thought you were done, your interviewer asks you this open-ended doozy. Don’t panic—it’s not a trick question! You can use this as an opportunity to close out the meeting on a high note in one of two ways, Zhang says. First, if there really is something relevant that you haven’t had a chance to mention, do it now. Otherwise, you can briefly summarize your qualifications. For example, Zhang says, you could say: “I think we’ve covered most of it, but just to summarize, it sounds like you’re looking for someone who can really hit the ground running. And with my previous experience [enumerate experience here], I think I’d be a great fit.”




53. Do you have any questions for us?
You probably already know that an interview isn’t just a chance for a hiring manager to grill you—it’s an opportunity to sniff out whether a job is the right fit from your perspective. What do you want to know about the position? The company? The department? The team? You’ll cover a lot of this in the actual interview, so have a few less-common questions ready to go. We especially like questions targeted to the interviewer (“What's your favorite part about working here?”) or the company’s growth (“What can you tell me about your new products or plans for growth?”) If you’re interviewing for a remote role, there are some specific questions you might want to ask related to that.",-0.110552564,0.2020259,0.33853534,-0.20902415,-0.072221674,0.16702254,-0.19479316,0.17424765,-0.101484224,0.022966253,0.09180984,-0.021823542,0.229713,-0.01004692,0.09057556,-0.27552268,0.17213489,0.13525683,-0.40243104,0.25661623,0.17200206,-0.059894837,0.14911,-0.050435912,0.14839008,-0.09277135,-0.14388622,-0.4825495,0.10314133,-0.16284664,-0.13669077,0.54051137,-0.03834907,0.033482205,-0.0056281574,0.3111478,-0.048613355,0.21813686,0.017610988,-0.16585642,-0.36773032,-0.22008537,0.10913409,-0.37369287,-0.19368324,0.04421237,0.15749808,-0.32917753,-0.0938661,-0.8104208,0.03210693,-0.06345066,0.11594768,1.0850908,-0.17645797,-2.3517363,0.056968503,-0.23395576,1.5890272,0.43898314,-0.13405414,0.7787159,-0.26503742,0.07596129,0.74963874,0.0075755264,0.4676482,0.3399829,0.14557055,-0.1956388,-0.008871552,-0.2639046,-0.09798999,-0.42560187,0.16350287,0.087582156,-0.16670355,-0.071420096,-0.7680905,-0.018464549,0.5571295,0.0794302,-0.4674292,0.078414984,-1.3991679,-0.18548077,0.12277995,-0.050479587,-0.21639442,-0.37083995,-0.085937545,-0.053411424,-0.083467335,-0.030862387,-0.46560875,-0.0666005,-0.20291509,-0.29260996,0.53587586,0.27292082
Interview_Answers,35+ Job Interview Questions and Answers [Full List],"﻿1) Tell me something about yourself.
How hard can it be to talk about yourself? We do it on a daily basis without much thought to it.


However, recruitment managers are not looking for your whole life story, your third-grade achievements, or what you had for dinner last night. Instead, they are looking for a pitch. 


This is usually the first question asked in an interview, so it acts as your introduction. Make sure your answer is relevant to the position you are applying for. What you should be aiming for here is to present yourself as the ideal candidate for the job.


A good rule of thumb is to structure your talking points as follows:


Briefly introduce yourself: What’s your name? How long have you been working as [profession]?
What do you love about your job?
What are your top 2-3 achievements that are relevant to the job you’re applying for?
Now, let’s go through some examples:


Possible Answers for ""Tell me About Yourself"":
Sample Answer 1:
Hey! So, my name is John Doe and I’ve worked as a business analyst for 5+ years in Company X and Company Y.


I have some background in data analysis, having studied Information Systems at [Made-Up] University.


Throughout my career, I’ve done some pretty impressive stuff (if I do say so myself, haha). 


For example, at Company X, I led a project for migrating all operations data to a new data warehousing system to cut down on costs. The new solution was a much better fit for our business, which eventually led to savings of up to $200,000 annually.


Sample Answer 2:
I am Jane Doe, a recent college graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 


I have just graduated with honors in Biochemistry. I know my way around a lab and have had multiple opportunities to put my knowledge into practice as a chemistry research assistant.


The lab felt like home, which is why I’d love to work as a lab assistant. I am passionate, hard-working, and extremely responsible. I am also looking forward to putting to practice all the things I learned during my time at university.


2) How did you hear about this position?
Although at first glance this might seem like a straightforward question, you should grab any opportunity you can to show your interest in the company. 


Even if you haven’t been continuously refreshing the company’s website for job listings, make it seem like you have (in a professional way, of course). Show excitement and curiosity.


If someone inside the company told you about the position or recommended that you apply, definitely make sure to mention that.


You’ll have a much better chance at getting hired if someone credible can vouch for your skills.


So, mention his/her name and his/her position inside the company and give their reasoning for inviting or recommending you to apply for the position. Tell the hiring managers what excites you about the job opportunity or what exactly caught your eye.


Possible answers for ""How did you hear about this position?"":
Sample answer 1:
“I’ve known about [MadeUpTechnologies] for a long time - I’m a big fan of your products. I even own one of your latest phone models!


I love the company’s passion for creating super intuitive, beautiful hardware, and I would love to be a part of it.


So, when I saw your job ad at [RandomJobBoardWebsite], even though I wasn’t actively looking for a job at the time, I couldn’t help but apply!”


Sample answer 2:
“I heard from Jim Doe, my old colleague and college friend, that [Company X] was looking for a new sales director. He encouraged me to apply, saying that my experience managing a sales team at [Some Software Company] would be helpful for [Company X].


I’ve heard a lot about [Company X] from Jim, and I’m a big fan of the way you do things there. I’ve always wanted to work for a company with a flat organizational structure.”


3) Why did you decide to apply for this position?
Through this question, the interviewers want to assess how passionate you are for the position. And no, the answer isn’t:


“Well, I’m very passionate about not starving to death.”


Or…


“Well, I needed the money, and you guys tend to pay a lot.”


What the interviewer is looking for here is to see how passionate you are about the job or the company. After all, job performance is directly linked to job satisfaction. The happier you are about your position at the company, the more productive you’ll be.


And here’s the kicker - your passion will be very evident during the interview.


When you’re talking to a person that’s passionate about something, you can pretty much feel them glow as they talk. And if you’re an HR manager who’s interviewed hundreds of people, this is a very good sign to hire the candidate.


So, use this knowledge to your advantage. 


When asked this question, your answer should include 2 things:


What motivated you to apply for this position, specifically.
Why this company? Have you heard of them before?
Sample Answer 1:
I’m very passionate about sustainability and renewable energy. In fact, I minored in Environmental Science at [XYZ University].


I’ve always wanted to put my engineering degree to a good cause - and the position as a Sustainability Coordinator at [Company XYZ] is just the right thing.


I’ve been following your company for the past few years, and I love how you’re changing the renewable energy landscape in America. 


Keep in mind, though, that if you don’t know much about the company or the position - that’s OK too. Just be honest and show your passion for the job. However, it’s always better to do your homework before going to an interview..


Possible answer 2:
I’ve always wanted to get into marketing. Having done promotional jobs here and there, I never had an opportunity to do something more serious.


I do believe, though, that I have just the right skills to get started: copywriting, basic photoshop, and of course, lots of creativity.


So, I thought that an internship at [Company X] would be an awesome start to my career in marketing.

4) What are your biggest strengths?
There are two answers you could go for here: what your actual strengths are, and what you think the hiring manager or HR representative wants to hear. We would most certainly suggest you go with the first answer. 


For this question, you would want to narrow your answer down to at most three strengths. Pick 1 or 2 skills that would help you really excel at the job, and 1 or 2 personal (more or less unrelated) skills. 


Not sure which ones are your top strengths? Check out the table below to learn which one’s perfect for your field:


top strengths for different fields
After picking your strengths, back it up with a situation or story that shows how you have used it to benefit you on the job. 


After all, words are just that - words. The HR can’t know whether your “natural leadership” is an actual strength, or just means that you were super active in your high school class.


As you probably already know, this is one of the most common interview questions out there, so make sure you’re prepared for it before facing the HR manager!


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
My biggest strength is that I’m good at picking up new skills. I’ve worked a variety of different odd jobs - things like working as a waiter, house-keeper, cook, and a lot more (as you’ve probably seen on my resume).


For most of those jobs, I ended up picking up all the needed skills within 1 or 2 weeks (with basically no previous experience). 


So, I’m pretty sure while I don’t have any experience as a bartender, I have the right certification, and I believe I can get good at it within a week or two.


Possible answer 2:
My biggest strength is that I’m very efficient at working under pressure. No matter the crisis or stress, I can make the right decisions on-the-spot.


As an event manager at Company X, we were organizing an IT conference for a client. There were a ton of last-minute hiccups - some speakers canceled and the catering company said they’d be late for the lunch break. On top of that, we were understaffed because 2 of our volunteer organizers got sick and couldn’t show up.


At that point, things looked so bleak that we were considering canceling the event or postponing it. Instead, I took the initiative in my hands and sorted through the problems one by one.


5) What is your biggest weakness?
Ah, this is always a tricky one! 


After all, you don’t want to mention your flaws during an interview, so it’s guaranteed to be a tough question.


The trick to answering this one is realizing that the interviewers don’t expect you to be perfect. Everyone has flaws, weaknesses, and things to improve on.


When asking this question, the HR manager is actually seeking to learn:


Whether you have the right skills for the job. If you’re applying for the position of a server in a busy restaurant, and you say your biggest weakness is performing under pressure, then you’re definitely not getting a callback.
If you’re self-aware and really know what your sticking points are.
And NO: fake humble-brag weaknesses don’t count as weaknesses. You can’t just say that your biggest weakness is that you work too hard, or that you’re a perfectionist.


The key here is to mention a weakness that’s real, but not something that would get in the way of you doing your job. You wouldn’t want to say you’re bad at math if you’re applying for an accountant position, would you


It’s also good practice to mention how you are working towards overcoming this weakness and realizing how it affects you negatively. If you can, just balance it with a positive side effect: treat it like two sides of the same coin.


Possible answers:
Sample answer 1:
My biggest weakness has always been my communication skills. I’ve been pretty shy and anxious as a kid. Over the years, however, I’ve been really working on the issue.


At this stage, I’m much better than I’ve ever been, but I’m still far from perfect.


This, however, won’t have any impact on my job as a programmer. Despite lacking communication skills, I’m very good at working in a team.


Sample answer 2:
Well, as a recent graduate, I’d say my biggest weakness is the lack of real-life work experience.


While I’ve worked on a dozen software projects in the university, I don’t have the experience of working in a fully agile environment with an experienced team.


I am, however, willing to do my best and catch up as fast as I can.

6) What do you know about this company/organization?
A quick search in the “About” page of the company/organization you are applying for should be enough, right? Well, yes and no. 


Think of this as an open-ended question. There’s no real wrong answer here, other than:


Incorrect Example
I don’t know anything about this organization. In fact, how did I end up here? Can you guys call me a cab real quick?


However, the more you actually know about the company, the better your chances of getting hired.


Imagine 2 equally competent candidates:


One who doesn’t particularly care much about your company, and is only applying because they know you pay good salaries
Another who’s been following your company blog for ages, loves your product, and has several friends already working in the company
Which one would you pick? Exactly, the second one!


So, with this job interview question, you want to convince the recruiter that you’re the candidate #2.


Now, how do you do that? Well, a rule of thumb here is to do some Googling before the interview and learn the following about the company:


What does their product or service do?
What impact does the product / service have?
What’s the company culture like?
What are the latest news about the company? How are they performing?
...And pretty much whatever other type of info you can dig up.
Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
I hadn’t heard about you until recently, actually. I found out about [Company X] through your job ad on RandomJobBoard.


After doing some brief research on you guys, I ended up falling in love with your software and your mission.


Now, I’ve worked with a ton of different project management software - Example Software 1, Example Software 2 - but none of them were as intuitive and as Example Software 3.


Sample Answer 2:
Well, I know that you’re one of the biggest investment banks in [town / state / country]. Company X pops up on news pretty often - I’ve read that you’ve invested in some of the hottest tech IPOs, and have several up-and-coming biotech companies in your portfolio.


I got particularly interested by your recent investment in [Startup X], I found that interesting because of [Y Reason].


7) Why should we hire you?
Ah, the ultimate humble-brag question. 


Now, the real question is, how do you sell yourself without trying to look arrogant, desperate, or needy? 


A good rule of thumb here is to stay away from the extremes. Think you’re a good fit for the job? Say that “you have the right experience.”


Whatever you do, don’t oversell yourself:


“I’m the best salesman you’ve ever met!”


Instead, make a general statement (I’m a great fit for the position because…) and talk about your experiences and achievements.


Here are 3 general points you can mention:


How you’re super passionate about working for the company (and why).
How your skills fit their requirements.
How you’re going to help the company solve their existing problems. Improve a metric, setup a process, etc.
Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
Well, as a start, I have all the skills and work experience required for the job. I’ve worked as a Sales Manager for 5+ years, and over the past 2, I’ve closed several deals totalling in 6-figures.


Oh, and on top of that, I have experience working with tech companies, so I’ll be able to pick up all the product specifics much faster than the other candidates.


Sample Answer 2:
I have just the right skill-set to excel as an executive assistant. While I haven’t previously worked as a personal assistant, I pretty much fit the bill for the role.


I’m extremely organized, having managed several project teams in my university. I led the organization of Event #1 and Event #2. This involved continuous communication with 12+ companies, 30 speakers, and 15+ sponsors.


I’m very meticulous and organized, and I’m more than capable of helping the CEO get the most our of their free time.

8) What are your salary requirements?
This is always a tricky question. You don’t want to lowball yourself, but at the same time, you don’t want to be told “No” because you gave such an outrageous number.


When answering, keep these 3 things in mind:


What’s the average salary for someone of your skill-level?
How much does the company pay employees of your skill level? GlassDoor should be super helpful here.
Finally, how much are you getting paid in your current company? In most cases, you can probably negotiate a pay bump from what you’re currently getting.
The final number you tell them should incorporate all 3 of the points we just mentioned. Do you know for a fact that the company is doing well (and compensates employees accordingly)? You’d quote a higher salary.


Is your skill-level above average? This should be reflected in your salary.


As a rule of thumb, you can figure out 2 numbers: what’s the “good” scenario, and what’s the “best” scenario?


Answer the interviewer with your “best” pay, and worst case scenario, they’ll negotiate it down.


Or, you can also answer with a range, and chances are, they’ll pick the number somewhere in the middle.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
My salary expectation is around $70,000 annually.


Sample Answer 2:
My salary requirement is in the $30,000 - $40,000 range annually.


9) Do you have any questions for us?
You’ll hear this question in every interview you will attend. 


While there isn’t a right answer, there IS a wrong answer:


Nope, all good! Thanks, I’ll go show myself out.


Instead, with this question, you want to show your enthusiasm about the company. Imagine they’ve already hired you and you’re starting tomorrow - what would you like to know about them?


Keep in mind, though, that the questions shouldn’t be too easy (So, what does your company do?).


Other than showing the recruiter that you’re really interested in working for them, this is your opportunity to really find out more about the ins and outs of the place. 


The answers you get from the interviewer could also be an indicator of whether you really want to work there or not. 


So, what kind of questions can you ask? Here are some of the most essential ones:


Possible questions to ask at the end of an interview:
What does a regular day in this company look like?
What’s the best thing about working for the company?
What’s the worst thing about working for the company?
What would you say are the biggest challenges a person in this position might face?
What are the most important skills and qualities one must have to succeed in this position?
What do you like best about working in this company?
What are the most pressing issues and projects that need to be addressed?
Do you have training programs available to employees?
What sort of budget is there for my department?
What kind of opportunities do you have for future development?
What are the performance expectations for someone in this position?
Do departments usually collaborate with one another?
Do you celebrate birthdays or retirements in the office?
Do employees usually hang out with each other outside of work?
Is there anything else I can help you with at this stage?
What is the next step in the hiring process?
For the complete list of all the questions you can ask the interviewer, check out our article!


10) What are you looking for in a new position?
The easiest way to answer this question would be to simply say that you’re looking for whatever the company is offering.


Look at it from the point of view of the potential employer. Would they hire someone if they answered this question with:


A good salary. And uhh, well, that’s about it!


This answer pretty much says that the moment they get a higher paying offer, they’re going to jump ship!


Instead, explain to the interviewer that this job at this company is the perfect fit for you. Mention what your short-term and long-term career goals are, and how this position ties to them.


Possible answer:
I’m looking to further apply my machine learning skills that I developed during my 2+ years of work at [Startup X]. There, I used to do programmatic ads model design.


Now, I’m looking for an opportunity to work on a larger scale project that involves setting up programmatic ads for audiences of more than 10 million people.


I believe that worked with such a large-scale project will allow me to progress significantly faster in my career.


11) Are you considering other positions in other companies?
Here’s a tricky one: How much does the HR manager need to know here? 


If you admit to having interviews with other companies, it might look like you’re not 100% dedicated to this one. 


On the other hand, if you say you are not considering other positions, it might make you seem like you don’t have other options (and the company has the upper hand in salary negotiations).


The right way to go about here is to find common ground between the two answers.


The interviewer is probably asking because they want to know whether they have competition in hiring you. They also want to know if you are serious about the industry and are legitimately looking to be employed in this field of work.


If you do have other interviews lined up for other companies, express that you are keeping your options open but that you favor this job in comparison to the others. 


Don’t have many other options? Stick to the same approach.


Whatever you do, don’t make it seem like you’re desperate or that you don’t have any other options.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
I have had two interviews during the past week with companies in X and Y industries.


However, as I’m very passionate about both your industry and the work you have done during the past several years, I am more inclined toward working for you, if everything works out.


Sample Answer 2:
Not yet - I wasn’t really actively looking for a job until my friend, [name], recommended your company. I’m not looking for just any company - I’m interested in an interesting, engaging project such as yours.


12) What is the professional achievement you’re most proud of?
This is another version of the “Why should we hire you” question, but with a focus on one very specific achievement.


This one’s pretty straightforward, just mention your #1 professional achievement and you’re good to go.


As a given, the achievement has to be related to the job you’re applying for. Let’s say you’re applying for the position of Sales Manager:


[Incorrect Example]
“I’m very good at underwater basket-weaving, having woven 20+ baskets in the past year.”


[Correct Example]
“In my previous sales position, I managed to hit and exceed department KPIs by 50%+ for 6 months in a row”


Keep in mind, though, that you want to be very specific with your answer. To get this right, try using the STAR method. It goes something like this:


S: Situation - Set the scene and context.


T: Task - Describe what your challenge or responsibility was.


A: Action - List and dwell on all the actions you took towards addressing the challenge or responsibility.


R: Result - Explain what the outcomes were and how they fit with the overall goal of the project or company.


So, find a work-related achievement that showcases your contribution through your skills and experience to something that matters to the company. 


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1: 
My biggest achievement is the fact that I went from being an intern to managing company X’s entire marketing over 2 years.


As an intern, I basically had 0 instructions on what to do - it went like “hey, go learn social media advertising and get it going.” The founders didn’t exactly expect me to achieve much, and didn’t particularly care, as they were 100% focused on making the product work.


Instead of just complaining about a lack of direction, I started reading up on digital marketing - pretty much anything I could get my hands on. I learned how to do content marketing for example, from Neil Patel’s blog, and started putting everything into practice.


My first success was getting an article to go viral, generating over $5,000 revenue in a single day. While that’s not much for a software company, it felt like a lot for an intern.


After that, the founding team gave me a lot more trust, and assigned me a small marketing budget of $1,000 per month. With a lot more confidence in my abilities, I started experimenting with other strategies.


Then, over the next 2 years, I got promoted to Head of Marketing. After making a couple of hires, I managed to scale up our marketing efforts, growing the company from $2,000 to $30,000 monthly recurring revenue.


Sample Answer 2: 
My greatest accomplishment so far is graduating from [University X] within 4 years, with a GPA of 3.9. My family was unable to support me financially, so I had to take care of all the university bills on my own.


Through hard work and dedication, I ended up graduating with almost no student loans. I managed this through a combination of:


Working part-time while studying
Doing seasonal full-time work during the summer
Maintaining a high CGPA and winning 2 scholarships over 4 years
13) What kind of work environment do you like best?
The aim of this question is to assess whether you’ll fit in the company’s working environment. 


For example, some organizations are pretty structured and hierarchical, they require tight organization and have a well-planned day filled with rules and guidelines on how to do things.


If you’re the creative, think-out-of-the-box type who likes to break the rules and innovate, this is probably not going to cut it for you.


On the other hand, some companies are more laid back, with a lot less bureaucracy. “Go get us more sales” can actually be your main duty for the week if you’re working in an early stage startup.


If you’re the type who prefers to have strict to-dos and objectives, you probably won’t enjoy such a job.


So, the takeaway? Different people work best in different environments, and that’s okay. 


Before you go to the interview, go through the company’s website and social media pages to get a sense of the general vibe and environment there. 


Look at employee reviews on GlassDoor, or if you know someone already working there, ask them. 


Depending on what you learn, answer accordingly.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
I work best in smaller companies. I really dislike the corporate world - rules, guidelines, SOPs, and so on. I perform best when I have a certain level of freedom to do things. Want to find innovative solutions to problems you didn’t even know you had? I’m your guy.


Want someone to just blindly follow instructions and do what they’re told? Then we’d probably not be a good fit.


Sample Answer 2:
I love working in a youthful, energetic environment. You know, when you’re working on a common goal with a team of people who are as passionate as you are?


I like to think of my work as a second home, and my coworkers as family. 


The last company I worked at had such an environment, and I excelled at the job.


I get that exact feeling about Company X, since the moment I walked in here for the interview. So, I’m pretty excited to get to know how you guys work!


14) Where do you see yourself in five years?
Sometimes the honest answer to this is “Hopefully not doing this.” especially with entry-level jobs. 


Don’t think the hiring manager doesn’t know it, though. There are diplomatic ways to go around it. 


In general, the motivation behind this question is for the interviewer to assess whether you are an ambitious person or not and whether you have realistic expectations for your career. 


Make sure to avoid any of the cliche answers such as…


“In your seat!”


Or


“As the big boss man”


Instead, think realistically about what the next step after this position is, and whether it is possible to reach it within the company you are applying at. 


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1: 
Within the next 5 years, I’d like to reach the position of a Senior Business Consultant. During the time period, I would like to accomplish the following:


Help 20+ organizations improve their business


Create a personal network of highly specialized professionals


Learn as much as I can about optimizing and improving clients’ businesses, as well as the essentials of operating a company


Sample Answer 2:
As a start, I want to learn if accounting is the right field for me. While I loved what I studied at the university, I want to see if working in the field feels the same.


If I do end up enjoying it, I’d like to specialize in either internal auditing or forensic accounting, as I really like to discover and solve problems. From what I’ve seen from your job ads, you guys are hiring for both, so I hope it’s going to be possible to move up from the position of an “intern” within the next few months!


Still not sure how to answer this one? We don’t blame you! Sometimes, you might not know what you’re doing next week, let alone next year! Check out our guide to answering the “Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” job interview question to find more possible answers.


How to Answer 18 Situational Job Interview Questions
Congrats! 


You’re past the hard part. 


You already know the most common job interview questions, and can probably deflect whatever the interviewer throws at you.


Depending on your specific situation, though, you might also need to learn how to answer these situational job interview questions...


1) Why haven’t you gotten your Master’s Degree/Ph.D.?
As a start, keep in mind that the interviewer isn’t judging you for your decision.


After all, if they were looking for someone with a better degree, they wouldn’t have invited you to an interview. The degree is not the dealbreaker here, but your answer to the question might be.


When asking this question, the interviewer is trying to see your reasoning for pursuing a career instead of getting another degree.


Heck, there’s a chance that if you give them the right answer, they’re even going to like you more than someone with 3 Phds!


So, simply explain why you didn’t think that another degree was the right thing for you at the time.


Don’t say you were lazy or didn’t feel like it, or that it’s a waste of money (even if that might be the case). 


Instead, give compelling arguments, such as…


You wanted to see whether your field was the right one for you.
You didn’t have the financial resources at the time.
You wanted to get some practical work experience before committing to another degree.
Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
At this stage of my life, I decided to pursue my career instead of further education. On the one hand, I want to make sure that Marketing is what I want to do with my life.


On the other hand, I believe that in my field, practical work experience is a lot more valuable than academic.


So far, my decision has paid off pretty well - I’ve already gotten a lot of experience doing online marketing for 3+ companies and delivering awesome results to boot.


I might eventually decide to pursue a masters, but at this point, I really don’t see the point in that.


Sample Answer 2:
Because it’s not in sync with my future career path. I believe that for software engineering, practical experience matters a lot more than having a degree.


I’ve already done an internship as a Junior Javascript Back-end Developer, and I believe that it gave me a lot more knowledge than my B.A. in Computer Science.


While I am eventually planning on getting a Masters, it’s going to be in a more theoretical field, such as Artificial Intelligence.


2) Why have you switched jobs so many times?
If you’ve switched jobs in a very short period of time (2 or more full-time positions in 1 year), the interviewer is bound to ask about it.


After all, job-hopping is one of the biggest red flags for HR managers.


True, you might have had a reasonable cause. Maybe the second company you got hired in just wasn’t a good culture fit for you.


Well, you’ll have to communicate that.


Companies tend to be skeptical because of the following reasons…


You might be a job hopper. Some people tend to switch jobs the moment they get a better salary offer.
You might be unqualified for the job and you quit because you couldn’t deliver.
You get bored easily and your solution to that is quitting.
So, your job here is to convince the interviewer that you don’t belong to any of those 3 categories. 


You need to make them realize that you will not jump ship a few months after getting hired just because some recruiter PM’d you on LinkedIn with a better offer.


The best way to answer this question is to explain the reason you switched jobs. It could be one of the following:


The company culture wasn’t a good fit. This happens to the best of us - sometimes, the company just isn’t the right one.
The job description was misleading and you ended up doing something you either didn’t enjoy, or were not qualified for.
You learned that you simply didn’t enjoy the job, and are not willing to try out something different. While this isn’t the best potential answer, it’s honest and chances are, the HR manager will understand.
Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1: 
The last company I got hired in just wasn’t what I expected. The hiring manager didn’t communicate the role well enough.


As you already know, I’m a copywriter - I write sales copy. I work with:


-Landing pages


-Email marketing


-And sales pages


Around a week after I started work at the company, I realized that they were actually looking for something completely different. They asked me to write generic blog and social media posts, which is pretty far off from what I do.


This was really not what I expected, and not something I find interesting.


Sample Answer 2:
Well, as a start, my first job was in a big corporation straight out of university. While I did learn a lot there about Software Engineering practices, I also learned that a huge company with lots of regulations, rules, and the like isn’t for me.


So, at the end of my internship there, I decided to try working at a startup. I enjoyed that job a LOT more, as it gave me a lot of freedom when it comes to problem-solving. I wasn't told HOW to do it. Rather, I was given the option of coming up with my own solution.


Unfortunately, the company went belly-up after failing to raise money, putting me back on the job market. 


And here we are - [Company X] is pretty much THE place I’ve always wanted to work in. I’ve heard a lot about your company culture, and thought I’d really belong there.


3) Why did you change your career path?
If you recently changed your career path, the interviewer is sure to ask about it.


Don’t worry - there’s nothing wrong with this. 


A lot of people go through a career change. Some even do it several times in their lifetime! 


As long as you’re good at what you do, no one cares if you were a pediatrician in one year, and a professional chef in another.


When asked this question, all you have to do is answer truthfully. Explain how your old job just wasn’t for you, and how the job you’re applying for is so much more interesting.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer
I realized that being a doctor is not for me. While I did enjoy my 3 years in med school, the 6 year study period was too much.


I wanted to start making money and help out my family way before that, so I dropped out of university and started taking online courses in accounting.


At this point, I’m pretty good at it, having done 2 internships so far in [Company X] and [Company Y].


Sample Answer 2
Simply because I enjoy doing sales much more than accounting. After 5 years of working as an accountant for Firm X, I decided I wanted to try something new.


I asked my boss at the time to let me transition to the sales team, and I ended up liking it AND being pretty good at it.


4) Why did you decide to leave your previous/current job?
When asking this question, the interviewer wants to learn:


Did you have a good reason for leaving your last job? The HR manager doesn’t want someone that just jumps ship the moment things go bad.
Incorrect Example:
“Oh, well, the company started bleeding cash and was on its way to bankruptcy.”


Correct Example:
“I felt like it was time - I got to a point where everything I was doing felt monotonous. I learned as much as I could at this position while delivering amazing results. It was, however, time to switch to something new.”


Did you leave on good terms? Meaning, did you go through the offboarding process, instructing your coworkers on how to take up your responsibilities? Or did you just say “Adios” and stopped showing up at work?
Incorrect Example:
“Things started to get really boring, and the boss man was kind of mean. I totally deserve better, so I just ghosted them and now I’m looking for a new company. Hi!”


Correct Example:
“I didn’t feel like the company’s values coincide with mine. The management was too controlling and micromanaging. I prefer to have some control over my work, and being able to contribute by going above and beyond my requirements.”


Of course, I went through the off-boarding properly. Meaning, gave a timely resignation notice, and transferred all the essential company knowledge to my replacement.”


Did you leave voluntarily, or were you fired?
Incorrect Example:
“I got fired for missing work for a week without an excuse.”


Correct Example:
“I was fired, actually. The fault was in my communication skills at the time. I misunderstood my supervisor’s instructions and ended ended up setting a higher monthly spend on ad account for the client. The losses were not more than 3-figures, but apparently, the relationship with the client was already strained, so they ended up leaving.


Of course, I really took this to heart and worked very hard on improving my communication skills, to ensure that I don’t make any mistakes of this nature ever again.”


5) Why is there a gap in your work experience?
In most cases, a gap in your work experience doesn’t really mean anything. You probably have a very good reason for it.


The interviewer, however, will definitely ask about it, and you should answer adequately.


There’s no secret sauce to answering this question, just let the recruiter know about your situation, whatever that may be:


Maternity leave
Health issues
Caring for a sick family member
Time off to pursue further education
Relocating to a different city
Working on a personal project
Whichever the case may be, just explain the situation in brief and move on.


One thing to keep in mind, however, is that if you were laid off at work, or you quit and had trouble getting a new job, you should be very subtle about it.


If the interviewer knows that you’re struggling to find a job, you’re going to give them the upper hand in salary negotiations.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
“I had a baby and had to take maternity leave.”


Sample Answer 2:
“My father was sick, so I had to be the one to take care of him full-time over a few months.”


6) Why were you fired?
Now this is a tough one.


Getting fired is pretty much never good.


Keep in mind that we’re talking about getting fired, not getting laid off. There’s a huge difference between the two:


Getting laid off means that you got let go for something that had nothing to do with your competence. I.e. budget cuts, company down-sizing, etc.
Getting fired, on the other hand, means that you got let go for a reasonable cause. And chances are, it’s probably your fault.
If you got fired and the interviewer asks you about it, you should be honest. After all, they can easily check-in with your previous employer.


Your best shot here is to be critical about your mistakes, and explain what you’ve done to improve.


Incorrect example:
“None of it was my fault. My boss is a total tool, and he hates me for no real reason. He yelled at me for no real reason!”


In the example above, the interviewee gets defensive. That’s a pretty huge red flag for the HR manager.


Instead, try saying something that shows that you’re aware of your mistakes.”


Correct example:
“The main fault was in miscommunication. The interviewer was unclear about the job responsibilities - from what I understood, they were looking for a senior-level marketer to oversee their email marketing operations.


At the end of the day, though, it turned out that the company was looking to experiment with email marketing, and specifically for someone to set it up from scratch.


While I did my best to deliver, in the end it turned out that their niche doesn’t actually need email marketing. This was against the management’s vision, so that decided to let me go.”


7) How do you feel about working weekends or late hours?
You’re gonna get asked this question in one of the following 2 cases:


1) You’re applying for a job that requires working odd hours.


In this case, your answer is pretty straightforward - since you’re applying for such a job, you probably don’t have any problems working odd hours.


Sample answer:
“Sure! I’m OK with working late hours or weekends, as long as you let me know about it at least a few days in advance.”


2) You’re applying for just about any other type of job.


Now, you should look at this as a red flag. Is the employer just checking your dedication, or are they looking for someone that’s going to work 24/7 with no overtime pay?


In this case, ask them to clarify what they mean.


Sample answer:
“Given enough warning, sure. Is that something I’ll be required to do often? Do you offer overtime pay for this kind of situation?”


8) How would your boss or coworkers describe you?
This question is pretty much the same as “what are your greatest strengths,” the only difference is that it should be from the point of view from your boss or coworkers.


Here, you want to focus on your traits and achievements that you’ve previously been praised for (After all, the interviewer might ask for a reference!).


There are at least 2 ways to answer this question:


1) Describe a specific situation where you excelled at work (and received praise from your boss and coworkers)


Sample Answer
“They’d say I’m super hard working. During my weekend-off, not one, but three of my coworkers got sick, and I had to spot for them.


The weekend was peak season in Nantucket, so the restaurant was getting seriously overwhelmed. All of a sudden, we went from being very prepared for the season, to complete panic.


Had to jump between serving, bussing, and line-cooking, but overall, managed to survive through the weekend successfully.”


2) Quote a performance review


If you’ve previously worked in an office job, you’re probably all too familiar with these.


Did your boss give you a glowing performance review? Make sure to mention it here!


Sample answer:
“Well, in my last performance review in September, my boss described me as someone who takes initiative.


My position as a PR manager involves constantly keeping track of our clients brand reputation, and if something goes wrong, dealing with it as fast as possible.


In a lot of cases, you need to be very proactive - if you wait for your entire team to have a meeting on how to deal with the issue, it might already be too late.


There were 4-5 different situations where I had to take charge and react to problems literally the moment they arose, whether it was during my work hours, or not.”


9) Do you have any serious medical conditions?
When asking this question, the interviewer wants to learn if you have any medical conditions that could impair your ability to do the job correctly.


In most cases, you’re not obliged to give an answer. If you do have a health condition, and it doesn’t have anything to do with your career, you can simply choose not to answer, or to say “No.”


However, you might want to disclose anything that could potentially have an impact on how you perform.


For example, if the job requires you to lift heavy boxes, for example, and you’re not able to do so because of a condition, you should let the HR manager know.


Possible answers:
[Sample Answer 1]
“I don’t have any serious medical conditions”


[Sample answer 2]
“I’m unable to lift heavy objects because of issues with my back, but it won’t have any impact on how I perform at an office job”


10) What would your first 30, 60, or 90 days look like in this role?
If you’re applying for a senior or leadership role, you’re probably going to get asked this question.


Chances are, at this stage of the interview, you already know a lot about your future position and the company.


Now, it’s time to show off your knowledge in your field, and explain how you’re going to start making things happen at the company.


So, here’s how to answer the question:


For the first 30 days:
You’re probably going to need to get to know the company first. You’re going to be learning as much as possible, including information on:


What does the company do?
What are the key processes?
What does your department do?
What are the current problems and challenges?
Where can you help?
Then, during the 60 days:
You’ll start start making things happen. From all the info you gathered, suggest a handful (3 to 5) initiatives you could take on:


You’d audit the company email marketing strategy and suggest improvements
You’ll help come up with better ad copies for Facebook marketing
You’ll help the team with their ongoing marketing initiatives
Within the first 90 days:
You’re already have started making an impact. Describe several things you think are going to be functioning better:


Online ads are going to be performing better by 10-20%
Email marketing operations are going to be more streamlined, taking significantly less manpower
11) Are you a team player?
Wherever you’re applying, the answer to this question should be a “Yes!”


Even if you’re applying for a completely solo role, chances are, you’re still going to have to work in a team occasionally. 


We’d recommend being very specific about your answer here - don’t just say yes. Give the interviewer an exact example of when you excelled at working with a team.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
“I’m much better at working in a team than alone, actually. That’s what I love about working in advertising - everyone has their own specific type of a creative spark, and when you combine it all, magic happens!


I’m good at both leading and following in terms of creativity and brainstorming. I’m also super receptive to others ideas, and do my best to help them execute it without nay-saying or criticism.”


Sample Answer 2:
“Yep, definitely. I excel at team-work. 


This one time while working at [Company X], I was assigned to an existing team working on a web application for a business process management company.


They were working on a tight deadline, and needed help on the API side.


I optimised their development cycles and oversaw a team of three developers while collaborating with the other two dev teams.


Everything went pretty well, and we managed to finish the project on time.”


12) Are you a risk-taker?
This one’s pretty tricky, as the answer here depends on your profession and field.


Ask yourself - is risk-taking a valuable skill for the job?


If you’re a pilot, for example, the answer should be a strict “No!”


If, on the other hand, you’re a day trader, then risk is an essential part of your job.


So, depending on how valuable risk is for your job, answer accordingly.


You could also give a more strategic answer. Let’s say, for example, you work in investment banking. You need to be a risk taker to an extent, but being too risk-friendly might make the entire company go bankrupt.


The strategy in such a case would be to show that you’re all about calculated risk. You’re willing to take chances, but only when the odds are in your favor.


As with most interview questions, you should give examples of situations where you had to take risks, and what the end-results were.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
“Yes, I’m a risk-taker. I believe that to achieve real results, you always need to be willing to take a certain level of risk.


Pretty much any marketing initiative you launch is tied to risk. You can plan everything from beginning till the end, but no matter how well you plan it out, things might just not work out.


It’s just part of the job - in order to succeed, you need to take launch risky campaigns on a regular basis, and hopefully, one in every 5 is going to bring you massive results.”


Sample Answer 2:
“I’m not a risk-taker, I’m more of a risk-manager. As someone who’s been in finance for years, I can say with a lot of confidence that there’s risk in everything.


The most important things are to one, minimize your risks, and two, minimize potential damages if everything goes very, very wrong.


While working at Investment Bank X, we had a very interesting policy for investing in new fintech projects. We used to avoid moon-shots, high-tech projects, as well as anything that had an experimental business model.


Our strategy was to invest in proven tech. As in, proven product-market fit, business model, etc. In most cases, these were runner up companies. We wouldn’t invest in that one innovative company that was all over the news - we’d instead invest in their latest competitor. More often than not, this ended up being more profitable, and significantly less risky.”


13) How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?
If you’re applying for a high-stress job, you’re guaranteed to get asked this question.


The aim of this question is to see if you’re the type of person who’d survive working at the job, or fall through the cracks when the first signs of trouble show up.


Obviously, you wouldn’t answer with the following…


“Well, I end up having a panic attack, crying, and running away from work.”


Instead, answer as follows…


Say that yes, you do tend to perform well during stressful situations
Give 1-2 examples of a situation where you had to perform well under pressure
Now, let’s go through some real-life examples:


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1:
“Though I can’t particularly say I enjoy stressful situations, I AM very good at working under pressure.


During chaos and panic, I tend to take a step back, think, plan, and prioritize.


For example, there have been times I’ve had to juggle multiple university projects and assignments at the same time. I would break up large assignments into small, individual tasks, and prioritize based on:


How fast I could complete each task
Figuring out which task would take the longest
Which project had the earliest deadline
This way, my work became a lot more manageable. The most times I had to experience such situations, the better I performed overall.”


Sample Answer 2: 
“I actually prefer working under pressure. I look at it as a challenge - a situation where I really have to up my game to succeed.


As a cook, working under pressure is pretty much part of the job. I’ve been in several situations where the restaurant was understaffed for the occasion. Heck, it’s pretty much a constant thing during peak season.


When there’s a ton of orders coming in and we can barely keep up, I tend to get significantly more productive than usual.”


14) Do you prefer hard work, or smart work?
By definition, hard work is when you, well, work hard. It’s when you’re willing to put in a lot of work to get the job done.


Smart work on the other hand, means doing the work efficiently. If you manage to get the job done in 2 hours instead of 5, with the same end-result, you’re doing smart work.


Keep in mind, though, that by asking this question, the interviewer is looking to understand what your work ethic is like. Meaning, they’re looking for a healthy combination of both, not just one.


That is, they want you to be the candidate who not only thinks smartly but works hard as well. 


So, your answer here shouldn’t be one-sided...


“Oh, I looove smart work. That’s when you come up with what to do, and make other people do it, right?”


Instead, explain how you excel at both:


Sample answer:
“I don’t particularly have a preference - I believe that both hard and smart work is important to get the best results.


Smart work, on one hand, lets you figure out the best and most efficient way to get things done.


Hard work, on the other hand, means that you’ll do the job right. Even if there’s no way to do it smart or efficiently, you’ll be willing to put in long hours of work to get it done.


I’m the type that does both. 


For an example of smart for, during my time at [Made Up Corporation], I was in charge of the sales department. As a process improvement initiative, I migrated from an outdated, in-house CRM, to Pipedrive. This improved the department’s productivity by around 20%.


On the other hand, the whole migration process took around 3 months of hard work. As the software we were using was outdated, trying to learn how to map and migrate our data was a lot more complicated than we’d expected.”


15) How quickly do you adapt to new technology?
Today, whether you’re applying for a software engineering job, or as a cashier in a supermarket, you’re going to need to use technology at least on some level.


It’s very common for a company to adopt new tech - new point of service system, self check-out kiosks, customer management software, and whatever else.


So, you should be able to pick up new tech ASAP. Any new change shouldn’t completely disrupt your work.


So, when answering this question, you should talk about how tech-savvy you are.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer: 
“I’m pretty tech-savvy. I’ve worked with a lot of different Point of Service systems so far, and have zero difficulties learning how to use new ones.”


As a given, I own a PC, have used Office 365, and all the usual stuff.”


Sample Answer 2:
“I’ve always been interested in tech. In fact, I’m the type of person to actively seek out new software to help solve business problems at work.


I’ve worked with 3 different Customer Management Software in the past, such as PipeDrive, SalesForce, and Zoho CRM.”


16) Do you have any interests outside of work?
If the interviewer asks you this question, take it as a good sign!


It means that they liked your professional background, and now they’re just trying to get to know you and see if you’re a good fit for the company culture.


It’s pretty hard to go wrong here, unless you’re going to answer something like:


“I have literally no hobbies.”


or...


“All I do is play video games all day.”


Just talk about your hobbies and interests, and you’re all set!


Bonus points if you can mention something that’s also relevant to your job (creative writing if you’re applying for a copywriting job, for example).


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1
“I’m a big fan of creative writing. I have my own personal short-story blog, and contribute actively to several online writing communities (such as Writing Prompts on Reddit).


Oh, and I’m also a huge fan of the New York Giants.”


Sample Answer 2
“Well, I’m very interested in all sorts of sports. I like to keep active, as it really helps keep me productive. Over the past 2 years, I’ve done a bit of everything - fencing, archery, hiking, and several other things.”


17) What do you think our company/organization could do better?
Well, this one’s interesting!


While not too common for most organizations, it’s a favorite amongst tech companies.


How come? Well, answering this question shows a couple of things…


That you’re really passionate about the organization, and have done your research
Are not afraid of giving feedback
Obviously, you should be very political about your feedback. You can’t just say that:


Incorrect example:
“Well, a lot of things really. I’m not enjoying this interview right here, for example.


And your product kinda sucks, no offense. But hey, there’s always room for improvement, am I right?”


Instead, you want to show off the research you’ve done. Talk about anything that might seem off about their product or business:


Correct example:
“I actually went through your resume builder before coming to the interview, and found several things that seemed kinda counter-intuitive.


Not to say that it’s too hard to understand, or something, but it took me a while to figure out some stuff.


If you want, I can open up my laptop and show you what I mean.”


How to Answer 3 Most Common Behavioral Questions in an Interview [w/ Possible Answers] 
Finally, behavioral job interview questions are questions that focus on how you’ve performed in the past, or how you’d perform in a specific situation.


They’re used to understand your thinking patterns, and whether you can think on your feet.


Remember the STAR interview method we discussed all the way up? Well, it can be used to answer just about any behavioral interview questions.


To brush up your memory, the main idea behind the STAR method is that each answer should involve the following:


S: Situation - Set the scene and context.
T: Task - Describe what your challenge or responsibility was.
A: Action - List and dwell on all the actions you took towards addressing the challenge or responsibility.
R: Result - Explain what the outcomes were and how they fit with the overall goal of the project or company.
Here are 3 of the most common behavioral interview questions (with sample answers):


1) Give an example of how you have handled a challenge in the workplace before.
What the interviewers want to know in this case is how well you handle conflict and difficulties.


So, the answer here should be pretty straightforward. You should describe a challenge you faced at work, and explain how you solved it.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1
“During my last job as a Google Ads expert, one of the company clients had accidentally butchered their own ad account. I noticed this over the weekend and saw that they were basically wasting money on nothing.


I took the initiative and immediately got in touch with the client to let them know about the issue. Then, we set up an impromptu meeting on the same day, and fixed the account before any real damage could be done.”


Sample Answer 2
“During my last job, I was managing the creative and web dev team in charge of creating an online store for a client. Two days before deploying, we found a major bug that messed up the whole front-end user experience.


Now, we could have pushed the deadline a bit, but that would have messed up the relationship with the client. The project was already postponed once because of unforeseen circumstances, so this one was a do or die.


I assembled a task force consisting of web developers from my team, as well as some software engineers from another department. We focused 100% of our time on fixing the issue, and actually managed to launch on time at the end.”


2) Give an example of when you performed well under pressure.
For any high-stress work environment, you’re guaranteed to get asked this question.


Possible answers:
Sample Answer 1
“I actually perform a lot better when under a lot of pressure. The sense of urgency and importance really motivates me to up my game and make sure everything works out right.


When I worked as a Financial Analyst at [MadeUpFinanceCompanyInc], most of the work was very high pressure. I had to go above and beyond the line of duty to make sure we met the tight deadlines set by our clients. This often meant working 12 hour work days, and sometimes, working over the weekend.”


Sample Answer 2
“As a seasonal worker, my entire career is high-pressure, haha... My last position was as a line cook during the summer at the SomeRestaurant in JacksonHole, Wyoming.


Around 3 out of 4 of the months were super high stress - there was a LOT of work, and the restaurant was pretty much always full. Heck, I’ve even had to skip breaks just to make sure we wouldn’t be understaffed.”


3) Give an example of when you showed leadership qualities.
Applying for a leadership position? You’ll definitely get asked this behavioral interview question.


Keep in mind, though, that this question doesn’t necessarily mean that you should have held a managerial position.


What the interviewer is asking for is a situation when you took the initiative and led a project or an initiative.


Possible answer:
“As an entry-level marketer, there was not much expected of me at SoftwareCompanyInc.. My main to-dos involved doing research, and completing whatever tasks were assigned to me.


During a content marketing brainstorming session, I came up with an awesome idea to market the company. The gist of it was, we’d interview company clients who were very successful at using the software, create case studies on what exactly they’re doing, and include it in our email marketing strategy.


The Chief Marketing Officer loved the idea and put me in charge of executing the project, which I did with flying colors.”",-0.10732249,0.19692308,0.33795646,-0.22021039,-0.07261345,0.14288269,-0.17557025,0.1782347,-0.12586312,0.030164102,0.11561156,-0.021029048,0.23521005,-0.0015801018,0.09625506,-0.28588125,0.17434391,0.118468605,-0.36613134,0.25116083,0.19258411,-0.019028723,0.1567798,-0.045988813,0.16274445,-0.101943724,-0.13149422,-0.48519206,0.05070844,-0.16268013,-0.12381263,0.5175768,-0.032859284,0.02422983,0.005506475,0.29044208,-0.058272287,0.23835452,0.016692493,-0.15986457,-0.35758466,-0.22105943,0.10340718,-0.36147377,-0.16661595,0.035760444,0.1783794,-0.32378587,-0.09529336,-0.8137928,0.038133796,-0.085311264,0.108737886,1.0759244,-0.23073563,-2.3822255,0.046610393,-0.22349766,1.6126226,0.46051237,-0.1356582,0.7721749,-0.28540316,0.08536405,0.7510777,0.004130103,0.47889096,0.31633526,0.14581817,-0.17002627,-0.021934297,-0.25141254,-0.1157158,-0.38981712,0.16298065,0.07858355,-0.16710246,-0.066587426,-0.80664784,-0.016898433,0.58075005,0.061076757,-0.48408058,0.08598563,-1.421116,-0.18553267,0.11822966,-0.08320722,-0.2076046,-0.38498625,-0.07369042,-0.060559455,-0.08559096,0.010507401,-0.47046196,-0.056630407,-0.20870323,-0.29053265,0.55815434,0.25822172

Microprocessors are used in many different kinds of devices, including computers, cell phones, and industrial robots. Microprocessors are very important because they allow computers to perform many different tasks. For example, microprocessors are used to control the flow of electricity in a computer. They also help computers store and retrieve information. Microprocessors are also used to create new products. For example, microprocessors are used to create new types of computers. They are also used to create new types of robots.


8. What is a class variable?
A class variable is a variable that is defined in a class and shared by all instances of the class. Class variables can be used to store information about an object, such as its name, its location in memory, and its state at any given time. Class variables are often used to store information that is shared by objects in the same class. For example, a class might have a variable called name that is shared by all instances of the class. Class variables are often created with the special keyword class.


9. What is a Software Development Life Cycle?
A software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process used to plan and manage the development of software. The SDLC is a set of activities that are performed over a period of time to ensure that the software is developed in a way that is efficient and effective. The SDLC can be divided into three phases: planning, design, and implementation. During the planning phase, the organization identifies the goals and objectives that need to be achieved. During the design phase, the organization identifies the requirements for the software that will be developed. During the implementation phase, the organization prepares the software for production and tests it to ensure that it meets all of its requirements. The SDLC is an important part of any software development process because it ensures that the software is developed in a way that is efficient and effective.




10. What is a programming language?
A programming language is a computer language designed to facilitate the creation of software. It is a set of rules and guidelines that govern the structure and format of computer programs. A programming language is typically a high-level language that abstracts away the complexities of programming in order to make it easier for programmers to understand and write code. There are many different programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python. The most popular programming languages today are C++ and Java. C++ is a high-level language that abstracts away the complexities of programming in order to make it easier for programmers to understand and write code.


11. What is Integrated Development Environment?
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software tool that allows developers to create, edit, and debug their software in a single interface. IDEs are typically used by software developers who work on large projects. IDEs are typically used to create and edit source code, as well as to debug and test programs. IDEs are also used to create documentation, as well as to share code between different teams. IDEs are typically used to create and edit source code, as well as to debug and test programs. IDEs also allow developers to create and edit documentation.




12. Explain the framework in software development?
A framework is a collection of reusable components that can be used to build software. Frameworks are often used to structure large projects and to help teams work together. Frameworks are usually built using a set of reusable components. These components can be used to build different types of software, such as web applications, desktop applications, and mobile apps. A framework can be used to structure large projects and to help teams work together. A framework can also be used to help teams understand the different stages of software development. For example, a framework can help teams understand the different stages of software development when building web applications.




13. What is an Interface?
An interface is a way of communicating between two objects. The objects can be software or hardware. An interface can be defined in many different ways, but the most common definition is that it is a way for one object to talk to another object. This communication can take many different forms, such as sending data to the other object, receiving data from the other object, or both. An interface can be implemented in many different ways, but the most common way is to use a software class. This class defines the interface and then other classes can use this class to implement the interface. When an object uses an interface, it is saying that it understands how the interface works and can use it to communicate with other objects.


14. What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a class that is not defined in the source code. Instead, it is defined in a file that contains a definition of the class. The file defines the class by defining all of the properties and methods of the class. However, the class does not have to be defined in the source code. Instead, it can be defined in a separate file that is included in the source code. The file can then be referenced by the source code. This allows the class to be abstract and still be defined in the source code. The main advantage of an abstract class is that it allows other classes to use the class without having to know all of its properties and methods. This makes it possible for other classes to use a class without knowing all of its properties and methods.


15. What is an array?
An array is a data structure that can hold a lot of data. Arrays are used in a lot of different applications, such as databases, spreadsheets, and games. Arrays are made up of different data types, such as numbers, strings, and characters. Arrays are also called indexed structures because they can be accessed by indexing. Arrays are one of the most important data structures in programming. They are used to store data in a way that is easy to access and to organize it in a way that makes sense. Arrays are also used in many different applications, such as databases, spreadsheets, and games. An array is a data structure that can hold a lot of data. Arrays are used in a lot of different applications, such as databases, spreadsheets, and games.


16. What is a constructor?
A constructor is a function that is called when an object is created. A constructor is a function that takes a few arguments the type of object to be created, the initial state of the object, and the name of the class that will contain the object. When an object is created, it is passed to the constructor of the class that contains the object. A constructor can be used in many different ways. For example, a constructor can be used to initialize an array of objects or to initialize a variable that will be used by multiple objects. In these cases, it is important to use a constructor that takes only a few arguments.




17. Define Cin and Cout in C++?
Cin and cout are two important functions in C++ that you should know about. Cin and cout are functions that allow you to read and write data to a stream. The basic syntax of cin and cout is as follows:


cin(stream) - Read data from the stream.
cin(stream, value) - Read data from the stream and assign a value to the variable.
cout(stream) - Write data to the stream.
cout(stream, value) - Write data to the stream and assign a value to the variable.
The first function cin takes a stream as an argument and reads data from the stream. The second function cout takes a stream as an argument and writes data to the stream. You can use cin and cout to read and write data from a file, a database, or any other source of data.


18. What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with the development of machines that can learn and process information. AI has applications in a wide range of fields, including robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In robotics, AI is used to build robots that can perform tasks that would be too difficult or dangerous for humans to perform. For example, AI could be used to build robots that can navigate through dangerous environments, such as mines or oil rigs. In machine learning, AI is used to train machines to recognize patterns and make decisions based on those patterns.




19. What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a field of computer science that deals with the identification and analysis of patterns in data. Machine learning algorithms can be used to identify patterns in data, such as relationships between variables, or to make predictions based on those relationships. Machine learning algorithms can be divided into two broad categories: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised machine learning algorithms, such as classification and regression, are used to identify patterns in data. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as clustering and association analysis, are used to identify associations between variables. The most common supervised machine learning algorithms are classification and regression.

22. Explain the access modifiers?
Access modifiers are a way of specifying which users have access to a resource. Access modifiers are often used to control access to data, files, or other resources. For example, a database might allow only certain users to see the data. Or, a file might be locked down so that only the owner can see it.


23. What do you mean by destructor?
A destructor is a function that is called when an object is destroyed. A destructor is a way to clean up after an object has been destroyed. When an object is destroyed, the memory associated with the object is released. When an object is created, the memory associated with the object is allocated. The destructor is called when the memory associated with the object is no longer needed. The destructor frees up the memory associated with the object and releases it into the environment. When an object is destroyed, it can be very difficult to find out why an object was destroyed.


24. What are the Layers of the OSI Model?
The OSI model is a system-level networking model that describes the topology of a network. The model consists of seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Transport, Network, Application, and Management. Each layer is responsible for providing a specific function. For example, the Physical layer provides connectivity between devices and the Data Link layer is responsible for data transmission. The Transport layer is responsible for routing data and the Network layer is responsible for managing the network. The Application layer is responsible for providing services to the devices on the network and the Management layer is responsible for managing the network. Each layer in the OSI model has a specific purpose and each layer in the OSI model has a specific role to play in the overall system.




25. What is the thread in programming?
The thread is a fundamental concept in programming. It is a way of organizing and managing code so that it can run in parallel. The thread is a way of keeping code running in the background while the main program is running. Threads are used to parallelize tasks and to share resources among multiple threads. When the main program runs, it sends instructions to the thread that is running the task. When the task is done, the thread that was running the task sends instructions to the main program that is waiting for instructions. This process continues until all tasks are done or until one of them crashes or gets interrupted. Threads are a fundamental concept in programming because they allow programs to run in parallel and to share resources. They are also useful for managing memory and CPU usage.


Computer Science Interview Questions for Experienced
26. What is the primary memory in programming?
The primary memory in programming is the data structure that is used to store the information that is used by the program to control the execution of the program. The primary memory is composed of variables, constants, and data types. The variables are used to store information about the current state of the program. The constants are used to store values that are known at compile-time and are needed by the program when it is run. The data types are used to store values that are known at runtime and are needed by the program when it is run.


The primary memory in programming is composed of three different types of data structures:


Variables - These are used to store information about the current state of the program. Variables can be used to store values such as numbers, strings, and booleans.
Constants - These are used to store values that are known at compile-time and are needed by the program when it is run. Constants can be used to store values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans.
Data types - These are used to store values that are known at runtime and are needed by the program when it is run. Data types can be used to store values such as arrays, lists, and dictionaries.

31. What is a singleton class?
A singleton class is a class that is defined once and only once. This can be used to reduce the number of classes you need to define in your application, and it can also be used to reduce the complexity of your code. When you define a singleton class, you are declaring that the class is only ever going to be created once. This can be useful if you want to reduce the number of instances that your class will have to create, and it can also be useful if you want to reduce the complexity of your code. Singleton classes are often used when you need to create a single instance of a class, but you don't want that instance to be shared across multiple objects. For example, if you want to create a single instance of a class that represents an image, you might create a singleton class that represents that image.


32. Is string class final?
Yes. The string class is final. This means that you cannot subclass it, and you cannot override its methods. This is a good thing because it means that you can use the string class without worrying about its internal state. There are a few things that you can do to subclass the string class, though. First, you can use StringBuilder to create a subclass of the string class. This class can then override the methods that you need to override to create your own subclass of the string class. Second, you can use StringBuffer to create a subclass of the string class. This class can then override the methods that you need to override to create your own subclass of the string class. Finally, you can use StringBuilder and StringBuffer together to create a subclass of the string class.


33. What is a wrapper class?
A wrapper class is a class that inherits from another class and then provides a set of methods and/or properties that are specific to its own purpose. Wrappers are typically used to hide implementation details from the user, allowing the developer to concentrate on the business logic. A wrapper class can be used to hide implementation details from the user, allowing the developer to concentrate on the business logic. Wrappers can also be used to provide a set of methods and/or properties that are specific to their own purpose. The main advantage of wrappers is that they allow you to hide implementation details from the user, allowing you to concentrate on the business logic. The main disadvantage of wrappers is that they can be difficult to maintain.


34. What are multiple inheritances in Java?
Multiple inheritances are a way of passing on multiple copies of a particular class or interface to a child's class. This can be useful when you want to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes. One way to do this is to create a subclass of the parent class, and then provide the child with a copy of the parent class. Another way is to create multiple inheritances in your Java code, and then provide the child with a reference to the parent class. Multiple inheritances are useful for situations where you need to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes. In Java, multiple inheritances are implemented using the public and private modifiers on a class or interface. When multiple inheritances are present, the public modifier indicates that the class or interface is publically accessible. The private modifier indicates that the class or interface is privately accessible. Multiple inheritances can be useful when you want to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes.




35. What is Cache?
A cache is a temporary storage location for frequently accessed data. Caches are useful for organizations that need to store large amounts of data in a short amount of time. They can also be used to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the network. Caches can be used to store data in several different ways. They can be used to store data that is frequently accessed, such as documents or images. They can also be used to store data that is rarely accessed, such as log files or application states. They can also be used to store data that is needed only occasionally, such as temporary files or cookies.




36. What is Deadlock?
A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are waiting for each other to finish. Deadlock occurs when one process is waiting for another process to finish before it can continue. The process that is waiting will not finish until the other process finishes. This can be a problem if you need to wait for a long time, as this can lead to your system becoming unresponsive.




37. What is a Critical Section?
A critical section is a section of code that is crucial to the operation of a program. By accessing critical sections, a program can make changes to the overall functionality of the program without affecting other sections of code. Critical sections are often accessed through functions, methods, and variables. The purpose of a critical section is to ensure that all parts of the program are working properly.




38. What is Multithreading?
Multithreading is a technique that allows multiple threads to run in parallel on a single processor. This allows multiple tasks to be run in parallel without the need for synchronization. In addition, multithreading can improve performance by allowing tasks to run in parallel without having to wait for each other to finish. For example, it is not appropriate for applications that require high performance or when the processor cannot support more than one thread at a time. Multithreading also has its own set of risks and pitfalls. For example, multithreading can lead to increased system load and increased system resource consumption.


39. What is normalization in a Database?
Normalization is a process of abstracting and simplifying data. It is a way of making data easier to understand and easier to work with. For example, if you have a data set that contains a lot of numbers, you can normalize it by taking the numbers and breaking them down into smaller pieces, such as by dividing by 10. This makes it easier to work with the data and makes it easier to see trends and patterns. You can also normalize your data by making it more consistent.


40. What is Indexing in DBMS?
Indexing is the process of organizing data in a way that makes it easier to find and access. In a database, the index is a collection of data organized in a way that makes it easy to search and find data.

27. What is z-index in CSS?
Z-index is a property in CSS that is used to define the order of elements on a web page. It works on the basis of order indices, where a higher-order element will appear before a lower-order element.


It only applies to elements that are positioned, i.e., those elements having the position attribute compulsorily.


Consider the following example:


div {
position: fixed;
left: 15px;
top: 20px;
z-index: -1;
}

28. Why are external style sheets preferred?
External style sheets provide an ample amount of advantages to developers. Some of the benefits are as follows:


Classes can be reused any number of times.
They allow for the style control of multiple documents through a single file.
Selectors and grouping can be used to apply styles easily.
29. What is the meaning of long polling in Web Development?
Long polling is a development pattern that is used to emulate a data push operation from a server to a client machine.


When long polling is operational, the client sends in a request to the server, and the data is pushed. The connection will timeout only when the data is sent to the client or after the timeout criteria are met.


30. What are some of the Web Development technologies that you know?
This question is very common in a Web Development interview. The answer is based on your learning, experience, and proficiency in this field. However, a good Web Developer will have profound working skills in any of the following technologies:


HTML
CSS
JavaScript
SQL
Python
PHP

31. What is the difference between cookies and local storage?
Cookies        Local Storage
Cookie data is accessible for both the client and the server        Data is stored only on the local browser in the client-side machine
Cookies have an expiry time, and data gets deleted post expiration        There is no expiry in local storage unless the data is manually deleted
In the next set of interview questions for web developers, we have a very important question regarding HTML and XHTML.


32. What is the difference between XHTML and HTML?
XHTML        HTML
Tags should be in lowercase        It is not case sensitive
Tags should be closed once opened        Open-ended tags can be used
Attributes must be enclosed in double quotes        Attributes can be used without quotation marks
33. What are the various data types present in JavaScript?
JavaScript supports the following data types:


Boolean
Number
Object
Undefined
Null
String
Function




34. How can styles or classes be changed in elements using JavaScript?
JavaScript can be used to easily modify classes and styles in an element by making use of the following syntax:


Modify styles: document.getElementById(“input”).style.fontSize = “10”;
Modify class: document.getElementById(“button”).className = “classname”;
Next up on this top Web Development interview questions and answers blog, let us take a look at the advanced set of questions.


Advanced Interview Questions
The following will cover the senior web developer interview questions but we suggest you go through them even if you are a fresher or an intermediate web developer candidate.




35. What are the types of popup boxes present in JavaScript?
There are three types of dialog boxes, which are used in JavaScript:


Alert: Presents users with a message and an ‘Ok’ button
Confirm: Gives the users a window with ‘Ok’ and ‘Cancel’ buttons
Prompt: Shows the user input, alongside ‘Ok’ and ‘Cancel’ buttons
36. What is the difference between <window.onload> and <onDocumentReady>?
The <window.onload> event is not called until a page is completely loaded with the entire styling from CSS and images. The event does add a bit of delay when rendering a web page. With the <onDocumentReady> event, it will wait only till the DOM is initialized and will begin the event action. This ensures to reduce any delays in actions.


37. How is type conversion handled in JavaScript?
JavaScript supports automatic type conversion. Since it is weakly typed, you can pass a function as an argument into another function easily.


This ensures that there are no errors or data type-associated warnings as values get converted to the required data type automatically.


38. What is the meaning of the scope of a variable in JavaScript?
Scope refers to the accessibility of functions and underlying variables in the running environment. There are two scopes supported in JavaScript:


Local scope: Here, values and functions declared inside the same function can only be accessed within that function and not outside it. Consider the following example:
// Code present here cannot use localVariable
function myFunction() {
var localVariable = ""This is a local variable"";
// Code present here can use localVariable
}
Global scope:  If a variable is declared as global, it can be accessed from anywhere in the application. Consider the following example:
var globalVariable = ""This is a Global variable"";
// Code present here can use globalVariable
function myFunction() {
// Code present here can also use globalVariable
}
39. How are comments used in JavaScript?
JavaScript supports two types of comment insertion in the code. Single-line comments and multi-line comments.


Single-line comment: “//” is used for single-line comment insertion
Example:


//This is a single-line comment


Multi-line comment: “/* */” is used to add multi-line comments
Example:


/* This
is a
multi-line
comment*/
Coming to the next set of interview questions for web developers, here is a common question for JavaScript.


40. What are undefined and undeclared variables in JavaScript?
Variables that have been declared already but not initialized are known as undefined variables.


On the other hand, if a variable is being used in a program without being declared, then it is considered an undeclared variable.


Consider the following example:


var undefVar;
alert(undefVar); // undefined variable
alert(notDeclared); // accessing an undeclared variable
41. What is the method used to submit forms in JavaScript?
Forms can be submitted easily in JavaScript by calling the following method:


document.forms[0].submit();
Here, the ‘0’ denotes the index of the form.


42. Why is <this> keyword used a lot in JavaScript?
The <this> keyword is used to access the current object present in a program. This object resides inside a method, and the keyword is used for referencing the corresponding variable or the object.


43. What is the use of the <defer> attribute in JavaScript?
The attribute is used as a boolean type attribute. It is used to delay the execution of the JavaScript code on a web page until the parser completely loads and initializes the page.




44. How can you prioritize SEO, maintainability, performance, and security in a web application?
This is a commonly asked question in a Web Development interview. Here, the interviewer is trying to assess your understanding of the working environment in the firm you’ve applied for.


If it is a large firm, then security will get higher priority over SEO. Whereas, if it is a publication firm, SEO gets the preference. A little groundwork about the company should help you answer this question.


The next web developer interview question we will look at is regarding jQuery. Let’s check it out.


45. What is the result if a jQuery Event Handler returns false?
If the jQuery Event Handler returns a boolean false value, it simply means that the event will not execute further and will halt the execution for the particular action it is associated with.


46. What is the use of the each() function in jQuery?
The each() function in jQuery is used to iterate over a set of elements. A function can be passed to each() method. This will result in the execution of each of the events for which the object has been called.


47. What is Pair Programming?
Pair programming is a scenario where you will be working closely with a colleague on the project, and this is done to help solve the problems at hand. If the development scenario is fast-paced, Agile development might not work efficiently. The interviewer asks this question to see whether you can work with other people easily and effectively.


48. What is the use of the $() function in jQuery?
The $() function is used as a wrapper to wrap objects into their jQuery counterparts. This is done to give users the ability to call any method that is defined for the jQuery object.


Note: Selectors can also be passed to the $() function, resulting in the output of a jQuery object that contains matched DOM elements.


49. What are the advantages of using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in jQuery?
CDNs are widely used in jQuery as they offer an ample number of advantages for users.


CDNs cause a significant reduction in the load for the server.
They provide large amounts of savings in the bandwidth.
jQuery frameworks load faster due to optimizations.
CDNs have a caching ability that adds to quicker load times.
50. What are the types of CDNs supported in jQuery?
There are two widely used CDNs with jQuery:


Microsoft: Used to load from jQuery AJAX CDN
Google: Used to load jQuery from the Google Libraries API

Interview_Answers,Top 45 Machine Learning Interview Questions & Answers 2023,"﻿1. What Are the Different Types of Machine Learning?
There are three types of machine learning:


Supervised Learning
In supervised machine learning, a model makes predictions or decisions based on past or labeled data. Labeled data refers to sets of data that are given tags or labels, and thus made more meaningful.


Supervised Learning


Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, we don't have labeled data. A model can identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the input data.


Unsupervised Learning


Reinforcement Learning
Using reinforcement learning, the model can learn based on the rewards it received for its previous action.


Reinforcement Learning


Consider an environment where an agent is working. The agent is given a target to achieve. Every time the agent takes some action toward the target, it is given positive feedback. And, if the action taken is going away from the goal, the agent is given negative feedback.

2. What is Overfitting, and How Can You Avoid It? 
The Overfitting is a situation that occurs when a model learns the training set too well, taking up random fluctuations in the training data as concepts. These impact the model’s ability to generalize and don’t apply to new data. 


When a model is given the training data, it shows 100 percent accuracy—technically a slight loss. But, when we use the test data, there may be an error and low efficiency. This condition is known as overfitting.


There are multiple ways of avoiding overfitting, such as:


Regularization. It involves a cost term for the features involved with the objective function
Making a simple model. With lesser variables and parameters, the variance can be reduced 
Cross-validation methods like k-folds can also be used
If some model parameters are likely to cause overfitting, techniques for regularization like LASSO can be used that penalize these parameters

3. What is ‘training Set’ and ‘test Set’ in a Machine Learning Model? How Much Data Will You Allocate for Your Training, Validation, and Test Sets?
There is a three-step process followed to create a model:


Train the model
Test the model 
Deploy the model
Training Set        Test Set
The training set is examples given to the model to analyze and learn
70% of the total data is typically taken as the training dataset
This is labeled data used to train the model
The test set is used to test the accuracy of the hypothesis generated by the model
Remaining 30% is taken as testing dataset
We test without labeled data and then verify results with labels
Consider a case where you have labeled data for 1,000 records. One way to train the model is to expose all 1,000 records during the training process. Then you take a small set of the same data to test the model, which would give good results in this case.


But, this is not an accurate way of testing. So, we set aside a portion of that data called the ‘test set’ before starting the training process. The remaining data is called the ‘training set’ that we use for training the model. The training set passes through the model multiple times until the accuracy is high, and errors are minimized.


Train Set


Now, we pass the test data to check if the model can accurately predict the values and determine if training is effective. If you get errors, you either need to change your model or retrain it with more data.


Test Set


Regarding the question of how to split the data into a training set and test set, there is no fixed rule, and the ratio can vary based on individual preferences. 


4. How Do You Handle Missing or Corrupted Data in a Dataset?
One of the easiest ways to handle missing or corrupted data is to drop those rows or columns or replace them entirely with some other value.


There are two useful methods in Pandas:


IsNull() and dropna() will help to find the columns/rows with missing data and drop them
Fillna() will replace the wrong values with a placeholder value
Panda


5. How Can You Choose a Classifier Based on a Training Set Data Size?
When the training set is small, a model that has a right bias and low variance seems to work better because they are less likely to overfit. 


For example, Naive Bayes works best when the training set is large. Models with low bias and high variance tend to perform better as they work fine with complex relationships.

6. Explain the Confusion Matrix with Respect to Machine Learning Algorithms.
A confusion matrix (or error matrix) is a specific table that is used to measure the performance of an algorithm. It is mostly used in supervised learning; in unsupervised learning, it’s called the matching matrix.


The confusion matrix has two parameters:


Actual
Predicted 
It also has identical sets of features in both of these dimensions.


Consider a confusion matrix (binary matrix) shown below:


Confusion Matrix


Here,


For actual values:


Total Yes = 12+1 = 13


Total No = 3+9 = 12 


Similarly, for predicted values:


Total Yes = 12+3 = 15


Total No = 1+9 = 10 


For a model to be accurate, the values across the diagonals should be high. The total sum of all the values in the matrix equals the total observations in the test data set. 


For the above matrix, total observations = 12+3+1+9 = 25


Now, accuracy = sum of the values across the diagonal/total dataset


= (12+9) / 25


= 21 / 25


= 84%


7. What Is a False Positive and False Negative and How Are They Significant?
False positives are those cases that wrongly get classified as True but are False. 


False negatives are those cases that wrongly get classified as False but are True.


In the term ‘False Positive,’ the word ‘Positive’ refers to the ‘Yes’ row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix. The complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as a positive, but the actual value is negative. 


Confusion Matrix 2


So, looking at the confusion matrix, we get:


False-positive = 3


True positive = 12


Similarly, in the term ‘False Negative,’ the word ‘Negative’ refers to the ‘No’ row of the predicted value in the confusion matrix. And the complete term indicates that the system has predicted it as negative, but the actual value is positive.


So, looking at the confusion matrix, we get:


False Negative = 1


True Negative = 9


8. What Are the Three Stages of Building a Model in Machine Learning?
The three stages of building a machine learning model are:


Model Building
Choose a suitable algorithm for the model and train it according to the requirement 
Model Testing
Check the accuracy of the model through the test data 
Applying the Model
Make the required changes after testing and use the final model for real-time projects
Here, it’s important to remember that once in a while, the model needs to be checked to make sure it’s working correctly. It should be modified to make sure that it is up-to-date.

9. What is Deep Learning?
The Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves systems that think and learn like humans using artificial neural networks. The term ‘deep’ comes from the fact that you can have several layers of neural networks. 


One of the primary differences between machine learning and deep learning is that feature engineering is done manually in machine learning. In the case of deep learning, the model consisting of neural networks will automatically determine which features to use (and which not to use). 


This is a commonly asked question asked in both Machine Learning Interviews as well as Deep Learning Interview Questions


10. What Are the Differences Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?

11. What Are the Applications of Supervised Machine Learning in Modern Businesses?
Applications of supervised machine learning include:


Email Spam Detection
Here we train the model using historical data that consists of emails categorized as spam or not spam. This labeled information is fed as input to the model.
Healthcare Diagnosis
By providing images regarding a disease, a model can be trained to detect if a person is suffering from the disease or not.
Sentiment Analysis
This refers to the process of using algorithms to mine documents and determine whether they’re positive, neutral, or negative in sentiment. 
Fraud Detection
By training the model to identify suspicious patterns, we can detect instances of possible fraud.

12. What is Semi-supervised Machine Learning?
Supervised learning uses data that is completely labeled, whereas unsupervised learning uses no training data.


In the case of semi-supervised learning, the training data contains a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.


Semi-supervised Learning


13. What Are Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques? 
There are two techniques used in unsupervised learning: clustering and association.


Clustering
Clustering problems involve data to be divided into subsets. These subsets, also called clusters, contain data that are similar to each other. Different clusters reveal different details about the objects, unlike classification or regression.


Clustering


Association
In an association problem, we identify patterns of associations between different variables or items.


For example, an e-commerce website can suggest other items for you to buy, based on the prior purchases that you have made, spending habits, items in your wishlist, other customers’ purchase habits, and so on.


Association


14. What is the Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning?
Supervised learning - This model learns from the labeled data and makes a future prediction as output 
Unsupervised learning - This model uses unlabeled input data and allows the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.

15. What is the Difference Between Inductive Machine Learning and Deductive Machine Learning? 
Inductive Learning        Deductive Learning
It observes instances based on defined principles to draw a conclusion
Example: Explaining to a child to keep away from the fire by showing a video where fire causes damage
It concludes experiences
Example: Allow the child to play with fire. If he or she gets burned, they will learn that it is dangerous and will refrain from making the same mistake again
16. Compare K-means and KNN Algorithms.
K-means        KNN
K-Means is unsupervised
K-Means is a clustering algorithm
The points in each cluster are similar to each other, and each cluster is different from its neighboring clusters
KNN is supervised in nature
KNN is a classification algorithm
It classifies an unlabeled observation based on its K (can be any number) surrounding neighbors
17. What Is ‘naive’ in the Naive Bayes Classifier?
The classifier is called ‘naive’ because it makes assumptions that may or may not turn out to be correct. 


The algorithm assumes that the presence of one feature of a class is not related to the presence of any other feature (absolute independence of features), given the class variable.


For instance, a fruit may be considered to be a cherry if it is red in color and round in shape, regardless of other features. This assumption may or may not be right (as an apple also matches the description).


18. Explain How a System Can Play a Game of Chess Using Reinforcement Learning.
Reinforcement learning has an environment and an agent. The agent performs some actions to achieve a specific goal. Every time the agent performs a task that is taking it towards the goal, it is rewarded. And, every time it takes a step that goes against that goal or in the reverse direction, it is penalized. 


Earlier, chess programs had to determine the best moves after much research on numerous factors. Building a machine designed to play such games would require many rules to be specified. 


With reinforced learning, we don’t have to deal with this problem as the learning agent learns by playing the game. It will make a move (decision), check if it’s the right move (feedback), and keep the outcomes in memory for the next step it takes (learning). There is a reward for every correct decision the system takes and punishment for the wrong one. 


19. How Will You Know Which Machine Learning Algorithm to Choose for Your Classification Problem?
While there is no fixed rule to choose an algorithm for a classification problem, you can follow these guidelines:


If accuracy is a concern, test different algorithms and cross-validate them
If the training dataset is small, use models that have low variance and high bias
If the training dataset is large, use models that have high variance and little bias
20. How is Amazon Able to Recommend Other Things to Buy? How Does the Recommendation Engine Work?
Once a user buys something from Amazon, Amazon stores that purchase data for future reference and finds products that are most likely also to be bought, it is possible because of the Association algorithm, which can identify patterns in a given dataset.

21. When Will You Use Classification over Regression?
Classification is used when your target is categorical, while regression is used when your target variable is continuous. Both classification and regression belong to the category of supervised machine learning algorithms. 


Examples of classification problems include:


Predicting yes or no
Estimating gender
Breed of an animal
Type of color
Examples of regression problems include:


Estimating sales and price of a product
Predicting the score of a team
Predicting the amount of rainfall
22. How Do You Design an Email Spam Filter?
Building a spam filter involves the following process:


The email spam filter will be fed with thousands of emails 
Each of these emails already has a label: ‘spam’ or ‘not spam.’
The supervised machine learning algorithm will then determine which type of emails are being marked as spam based on spam words like the lottery, free offer, no money, full refund, etc.
The next time an email is about to hit your inbox, the spam filter will use statistical analysis and algorithms like Decision Trees and SVM to determine how likely the email is spam
If the likelihood is high, it will label it as spam, and the email won’t hit your inbox
Based on the accuracy of each model, we will use the algorithm with the highest accuracy after testing all the models
Email


23. What is a Random Forest?
A ‘random forest’ is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is generally used for classification problems. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during the training phase. The random forest chooses the decision of the majority of the trees as the final decision. 


Random Forest


24. Considering a Long List of Machine Learning Algorithms, given a Data Set, How Do You Decide Which One to Use?
There is no master algorithm for all situations. Choosing an algorithm depends on the following questions:


How much data do you have, and is it continuous or categorical?
Is the problem related to classification, association, clustering, or regression?
Predefined variables (labeled), unlabeled, or mix?
What is the goal?
Based on the above questions, the following algorithms can be used:

25. What is Bias and Variance in a Machine Learning Model?
Bias
Bias in a machine learning model occurs when the predicted values are further from the actual values. Low bias indicates a model where the prediction values are very close to the actual ones.


Underfitting: High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs. 


Variance
Variance refers to the amount the target model will change when trained with different training data. For a good model, the variance should be minimized. 


Overfitting: High variance can cause an algorithm to model the random noise in the training data rather than the intended outputs.


26. What is the Trade-off Between Bias and Variance?
The bias-variance decomposition essentially decomposes the learning error from any algorithm by adding the bias, variance, and a bit of irreducible error due to noise in the underlying dataset. 


Necessarily, if you make the model more complex and add more variables, you’ll lose bias but gain variance. To get the optimally-reduced amount of error, you’ll have to trade off bias and variance. Neither high bias nor high variance is desired.


High bias and low variance algorithms train models that are consistent, but inaccurate on average.


High variance and low bias algorithms train models that are accurate but inconsistent. 


27. Define Precision and Recall.
Precision
Precision is the ratio of several events you can correctly recall to the total number of events you recall (mix of correct and wrong recalls).


Precision = (True Positive) / (True Positive + False Positive)


Recall
A recall is the ratio of the number of events you can recall the number of total events.


Recall = (True Positive) / (True Positive + False Negative)


28. What is a Decision Tree Classification?
A decision tree builds classification (or regression) models as a tree structure, with datasets broken up into ever-smaller subsets while developing the decision tree, literally in a tree-like way with branches and nodes. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data. 


29. What is Pruning in Decision Trees, and How Is It Done?
Pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees. It reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting. 


Pruning can occur in:


Top-down fashion. It will traverse nodes and trim subtrees starting at the root
Bottom-up fashion. It will begin at the leaf nodes
There is a popular pruning algorithm called reduced error pruning, in which:


Starting at the leaves, each node is replaced with its most popular class
If the prediction accuracy is not affected, the change is kept
There is an advantage of simplicity and speed
30. Briefly Explain Logistic Regression.
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to predict a binary outcome for a given set of independent variables. 


The output of logistic regression is either a 0 or 1 with a threshold value of generally 0.5. Any value above 0.5 is considered as 1, and any point below 0.5 is considered as 0.


Logistic Regression


31. Explain the K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm. 
K nearest neighbor algorithm is a classification algorithm that works in a way that a new data point is assigned to a neighboring group to which it is most similar. 


In K nearest neighbors, K can be an integer greater than 1. So, for every new data point, we want to classify, we compute to which neighboring group it is closest. 


Let us classify an object using the following example. Consider there are three clusters:


Football
Basketball 
Tennis ball
Kluster 1


Let the new data point to be classified is a black ball. We use KNN to classify it. Assume K = 5 (initially). 


Next, we find the K (five) nearest data points, as shown.


Kluster 2


Observe that all five selected points do not belong to the same cluster. There are three tennis balls and one each of basketball and football. 


When multiple classes are involved, we prefer the majority. Here the majority is with the tennis ball, so the new data point is assigned to this cluster.


32. What is a Recommendation System?
Anyone who has used Spotify or shopped at Amazon will recognize a recommendation system: It’s an information filtering system that predicts what a user might want to hear or see based on choice patterns provided by the user.


33. What is Kernel SVM?
Kernel SVM is the abbreviated version of the kernel support vector machine. Kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, and the most common one is the kernel SVM.


34. What Are Some Methods of Reducing Dimensionality?
You can reduce dimensionality by combining features with feature engineering, removing collinear features, or using algorithmic dimensionality reduction.


Now that you have gone through these machine learning interview questions, you must have got an idea of your strengths and weaknesses in this domain.


35. What is Principal Component Analysis?
Principal Component Analysis or PCA is a multivariate statistical technique that is used for analyzing quantitative data. The objective of PCA is to reduce higher dimensional data to lower dimensions, remove noise, and extract crucial information such as features and attributes from large amounts of data.


36. What do you understand by the F1 score?
The F1 score is a metric that combines both Precision and Recall. It is also the weighted average of precision and recall. 


The F1 score can be calculated using the below formula:


F1 = 2 * (P * R) / (P + R)


The F1 score is one when both Precision and Recall scores are one.


37. What do you understand by Type I vs Type II error?
Type I Error: Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is true and we reject it.


Type II Error: Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is false and we accept it.

38. Explain Correlation and Covariance?
Correlation: Correlation tells us how strongly two random variables are related to each other. It takes values between -1 to +1. 


Formula to calculate Correlation:


ML_QandA_38.


Covariance: Covariance tells us the direction of the linear relationship between two random variables. It can take any value between - ∞ and + ∞.


Formula to calculate Covariance:


ML_QandA_38_1.


39. What are Support Vectors in SVM?
Support Vectors are data points that are nearest to the hyperplane. It influences the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Removing the support vectors will alter the position of the hyperplane. The support vectors help us build our support vector machine model.


ML_QandA_39


40. What is Ensemble learning?
Ensemble learning is a combination of the results obtained from multiple machine learning models to increase the accuracy for improved decision-making. 


Example: A Random Forest with 100 trees can provide much better results than using just one decision tree.


ML_QandA_40


41. What is Cross-Validation?
Cross-Validation in Machine Learning is a statistical resampling technique that uses different parts of the dataset to train and test a machine learning algorithm on different iterations. The aim of cross-validation is to test the model’s ability to predict a new set of data that was not used to train the model. Cross-validation avoids the overfitting of data.


K-Fold Cross Validation is the most popular resampling technique that divides the whole dataset into K sets of equal sizes.


42. What are the different methods to split a tree in a decision tree algorithm?
Variance: Splitting the nodes of a decision tree using the variance is done when the target variable is continuous.


ML_QandA_42


Information Gain: Splitting the nodes of a decision tree using Information Gain is preferred when the target variable is categorical.


ML_QandA_42_1


Gini Impurity: Splitting the nodes of a decision tree using Gini Impurity is followed when the target variable is categorical.


ML_QandA_42_2.


43. How does the Support Vector Machine algorithm handle self-learning? 
The SVM algorithm has a learning rate and expansion rate which takes care of self-learning. The learning rate compensates or penalizes the hyperplanes for making all the incorrect moves while the expansion rate handles finding the maximum separation area between different classes.


44. What are the assumptions you need to take before starting with linear regression?
There are primarily 5 assumptions for a Linear Regression model:


Multivariate normality
No auto-correlation
Homoscedasticity
Linear relationship
No or little multicollinearity
45. What is the difference between Lasso and Ridge regression?
Lasso(also known as L1) and Ridge(also known as L2) regression are two popular regularization techniques that are used to avoid overfitting of data. These methods are used to penalize the coefficients to find the optimum solution and reduce complexity. The Lasso regression works by penalizing the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. In Ridge or L2 regression, the penalty function is determined by the sum of the squares of the coefficients.",-0.19788063,0.22518629,0.32064736,-0.08996173,0.03584438,0.121483825,-0.13398175,0.18467313,-0.18341905,0.12259975,0.06607195,-0.076844126,0.24682371,0.014199361,0.21291535,-0.15579626,0.22279927,0.097395524,-0.21789056,0.1568175,0.14180535,-0.19532613,0.24144483,0.07887425,0.16025338,-0.17185989,0.022569602,-0.38034493,-0.09409403,-0.1237833,-0.06964571,0.4689672,-0.14845274,0.032574493,0.12275983,0.19259237,0.08245294,0.23471843,-0.026474763,-0.13962221,-0.3479352,-0.26478827,0.046734616,-0.27609345,-0.070020325,0.041102696,0.22076826,-0.29224724,-0.19087604,-0.58126146,0.09594583,-0.05662125,0.15312082,1.0449725,-0.2045713,-2.1998255,0.0076606967,-0.2629356,1.55566,0.45457542,-0.16861454,0.5863402,-0.14848356,0.17343108,0.7727887,0.01717879,0.2784242,0.1619866,0.26226962,-0.16218449,-0.12313698,-0.20763806,-0.049303845,-0.2522136,0.27010542,0.004954242,-0.09917599,-0.0678018,-0.8334278,-0.032944232,0.5172578,0.0571494,-0.560926,0.056027655,-1.2911956,-0.057436917,0.18949795,-0.1956007,-0.040061478,-0.29308748,-0.19828257,-0.001980933,-0.19204454,0.11923148,-0.33024132,-0.09232534,-0.2214718,-0.4211546,0.5706266,0.13921097
Interview_Answers,Top 40 Coding Interview Questions You Should Know,"﻿Coding Interview Questions On Conceptual Understanding
This section covers some coding interview questions that test the conceptual understanding of the candidate.


1. What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a storage format that defines the way data is stored, organized, and manipulated.
Some popular data structures are Arrays, Trees, and Graphs.
2. What is an Array?
An array is commonly referred to as a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
Items stored are of the same type.
It organizes data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.
array string


Fig: Array


3. What is a Linked List?
Like an array, a linked list refers to a linear data structure in which the elements are not necessarily stored in a contiguous manner.
It is basically a sequence of nodes, each node points towards the next node forming a chain-like structure.
linked list


Fig: Linked List


4. What is LIFO?
LIFO is an abbreviation for Last In First Out
It is a way of accessing, storing and retrieving data.
It extracts the data that was stored last first.
5. What is a Stack?
A stack refers to a linear data structure performing operations in a LIFO (Last In First Out) order.
In a stack, elements can only be accessed, starting from the topmost to the bottom element.
6. What is FIFO?
FIFO stands for First In First Out.
It is a way of accessing, storing and retrieving data.
The data that was stored first is extracted first.
lifo fifo


Fig: LIFO, FIFO








7. What is a Queue?
A queue refers to a linear data structure that performs operations in a FIFO order.
In a queue, the least recently added elements are removed first as opposed to a stack. 
queue


Fig: Queue


8. What are Binary Trees?
A binary tree is an extension of the linked list structure where each node has at most two children. 
A binary tree has two nodes at all times, a left node and a right node.
binary-tees


Fig: Binary Trees


9. What is Recursion?
Recursion refers to a function calling itself based on a terminating condition.
It uses LIFO and therefore makes use of the stack data structure.
The next couple of coding interview questions will explore your knowledge of OOPs.


10. What is the OOPs concept?
OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming System, a paradigm that provides concepts such as objects, classes, and inheritance.


11. What are the concepts introduced in OOPs?
Following are the concepts introduced in OOPs:


Object - A real-world entity having a particular state and behavior. We can define it as an instance of a class.
Class - A logical entity that defines the blueprint from which an object can be created or instantiated.
Inheritance - A concept that refers to an object gaining all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It provides code reusability.
Polymorphism - A concept that allows a task to be performed in different ways. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
Abstraction - A concept that hides the internal details of an application and only shows the functionality. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
Encapsulation - A concept that refers to the wrapping of code and data together into a single unit.
This is one of the very common coding interview questions, that often allows the interviewer to branch out into related topics based on the candidate’s answers


12. Explain what a Binary Search Tree is.
A binary search tree is used to store data in a manner that it can be retrieved very efficiently. 
The left sub-tree contains nodes whose keys are less than the node’s key value.
The right sub-tree contains nodes whose keys are greater than or equal to the node’s key value
binary search


Fig: Binary Search Tree




13. Explain Doubly Linked Lists?
Doubly linked lists are categorized as a special type of linked list in which traversal across the data elements can be done in both directions. 
This is made possible by the presence of two links in every node, one that links to the node next to it and another that connects to the node before it.
doubly link


Fig: Doubly Linked List


14. What is a Graph?
A graph is a particular type of data structure that contains a set of ordered pairs.
The ordered pairs in a graph are also known as edges or arcs and are most commonly used to connect nodes where the data can be stored and retrieved.
15. Differentiate between linear and non-linear data structure?
Linear data structure
Non-linear data structure
It is a structure in which data elements are adjacent to each other


It is a structure in which each data element can connect to over two adjacent data elements


Examples of linear data structure include linked lists, arrays, queues, and stacks


Examples of nonlinear data structure include graphs and trees


16. What is a Deque?
A deque is a double-ended queue.
This is a structure in which elements can be inserted or removed from either end.
17. What’s the difference between Stack and Array?
Stack


Array


Stack follows a Last In First Out (LIFO) pattern. What this means is that data access necessarily follows a particular sequence where the last data to be stored is the first one that will be extracted.


On the other hand, Arrays do not follow a specific order, but instead can be accessed or called by referring to the indexed element within the array.




18. Which sorting algorithm is the best?
There are many types of sorting algorithms: bubble sort, quick sort, balloon sort, merge sort, radix sort, and more.
No algorithm can be considered as the best or fastest because they have designed each for a specific type of data structure where it performs the best
19. How does variable declaration affect memory?
The amount of memory that is to be reserved or allocated depends on the data type being stored in that variable. 
For example, if a variable is declared to be “integer type”, 32 bits of memory storage will then be reserved for that particular variable.
20. What are dynamic data structures?
Dynamic data structures have the feature where they expand and contract as a program runs. It provides a very flexible method of data manipulation because adjusts based on the size of the data to be manipulated.


These 20 coding interview questions that test the conceptual understanding of the candidates give the interview a clear idea on how strong the candidate’s fundamentals are


Programming Interview Questions
The next set of coding interview questions focus tests the programming expertise of the candidates and dives deep into various related aspects.


The code screenshots given along with the below coding interview questions helps you provide the answer to the question, with clarity.


21. How do you reverse a string in Java?
Declare a string.
Take out the length of that string.
Loop through the characters of the string.
Add the characters in reverse order in the new string.
String str = ""hello"";


String reverse = """";


int length = str.length();


for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {


     reverse = str.charAt(i) + reverse;


}


System.out.println(reverse);
22. How do you determine if a string is a palindrome?
A string is a palindrome when it stays the same on reversing the order of characters in that string.
It can be achieved by reversing the original string first and then checking if the reversed string is equal to the original string.
if (str.equals(reverse)) {


    System.out.println(""Palindrome"");


} else {


    System.out.println(""Not Palindrome"");


}


23. Find the number of occurrences of a character in a String?
To find the number of occurrences, loop through the string and search for that character at every iteration; whenever it is found, it will update the count.


int count = 0;


char search = 'a';


for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {


    if (str.charAt(i) == search) {


        count++;


    }


}


System.out.println(count);
24. How to find out if the given two strings are anagrams or not?
Two strings are anagrams if they contain a similar group of characters in a varied sequence.


Declare a boolean variable that tells at the end of the two strings are anagrams or not.
First, check if the length of both strings is the same, if not, they cannot be anagrams.
Convert both the strings to character arrays and then sort them.
Check if the sorted arrays are equal. If they are equal, print anagrams, otherwise not anagrams. 
boolean anagrmstat = false;


if (str.length() != reverse.length()) {


    System.out.println(str + "" and "" + reverse + "" not anagrams string"");


} else {


    char[] anagram1 = str.toCharArray();


    char[] anagram2 = reverse.toCharArray();


    Arrays.sort(anagram1);


    Arrays.sort(anagram2);


    anagrmstat = Arrays.equals(anagram1, anagram2);


}


if (anagrmstat == true) {


    System.out.println("" anagrams string"");


} else {


    System.out.println("" not anagrams string"");


}


25. How do you calculate the number of vowels and consonants in a String?
Loop through the string.
Increase the vowel variable by one whenever the character is found to be a vowel, using the if condition. Otherwise, increment the consonant variable.
Print the values of both the vowel and the consonant count.
int vowels = 0;


int consonants = 0;


for (int k = 0; k < str.length(); k++) {


    char c = str.charAt(k);


    if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u')


        vowels++;


    else


        consonants++;


}


System.out.println(""Vowel count is "" + vowels);


System.out.println(""Consonant count is: "" + consonants);


26. How do you get the matching elements in an integer array?
Declare an array.
Nest a couple of loops to compare the numbers with other numbers in the array.
Print the matching elements if found.
int[] a = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 6, 7 };


for (int m = 0; m < a.length; m++) {


    for (int n = m + 1; n < a.length; n++) {


        if (a[m] == a[n])


            System.out.print(a[m]);


    }


}


27. How would you implement the bubble sort algorithm?
Declare an array.
Nest a couple of loops to compare the numbers in the array.
The array will be sorted in ascending order by replacing the elements if found in any other order.
int[] a = { 1, 2, 7, 6, 4, 9, 12 };


for (int k = 0; k < a.length; k++) {


    for (int l = 0; l < a.length - l - 1; l++) {


        if (a[l] > a[l + 1]) {


            int t = a[l];


            a[l] = a[l + 1];


            a[l + 1] = t;


        }


    }


}




28. How would you implement the insertion sort algorithm?
We assume the first element in the array to be sorted. The second element is stored separately in the key. This sorts the first two elements. You can then take the third element and do a comparison with the ones on the left of it. This process will go on until a point where we sort the array.
int[] a = { 1, 2, 7, 6, 4, 9, 12 };


for (int m = 1; m < a.length; m++) {


    int n = m;


    while (n > 0 && a[n - 1] > a[n]) {


        int k = a[n];


        a[n] = a[n - 1];


        a[n - 1] = k;


        n--;


    }


}


29. How do you reverse an array?
Loop till the half-length of the array.
Replace the numbers corresponding to the indexes from the starting and the end.
int[] a = { 1, 2, 7, 6, 4, 9, 12 };


for (int t = 0; t < a.length / 2; t++) { 


    int tmp = a[t]; 


    a[t] = a[a.length - t - 1]; 


    a[a.length - t- 1] = tmp; 


} 




30. How would you swap two numbers without using a third variable?
Declare two variables and initialize them with values.
Make b the sum of both numbers.
Then subtract the sum (b) from a, so a is now swapped.
Lastly, subtract a from the sum (b), so b is also swapped.
int a = 10;


int b = 20;


b = b + a; // now b is sum of both the numbers


a = b - a; // b - a = (b + a) - a = b (a is swapped)


b = b - a; // (b + a) - b = a (b is swapped)


31. Print a Fibonacci series using recursion?
The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..


We can calculate them using the mathematical formula used in the Fibonacci recursive function.
public static int fibonacci(int n) {


    if (n <= 1)


        return n;


    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);


}


public static void main(String args[]) {


    int n = 10;


    System.out.println(fibonacci(n));


}


32. How do you find the factorial of an integer?
A factorial is a function that multiplies a number by every number below it. For example, 5!= 5*4*3*2*1=120.
Recursive function multiples the numbers until it reaches 1.
public static long factorial(long n) {


if (n == 1)


    return 1;


else


    return (n * factorial(n - 1));


}


33. How do you reverse a Linked List?
Declare a linked list.
Add elements to that linked list.
Apply the descending iterator method to the linked list.
This reverses the order of elements in the linked list.
LinkedList<Integer> ll = new LinkedList<>();


ll.add(1);


ll.add(2);


ll.add(3);


System.out.println(ll);


LinkedList<Integer> ll1 = new LinkedList<>();


ll.descendingIterator().forEachRemaining(ll1::add);


System.out.println(ll1);




34. How would you implement Binary Search?
Binary search divides the array into half in every iteration step until it finds the element.
It works on the sorted arrays since it compares the values of adjacent elements and then calculates the mid number.
If the value of low becomes greater than high at any point, it means the element is not present in the list.
int mid = (low + high) / 2;


while (low <= high) {


    if (arr[mid] < key) {


        low = mid + 1;


    } else if (arr[mid] == key) {


        return mid;


    } else {


        high = mid - 1;


    }


    mid = (low + high) / 2;


}


if (low > high) {


    return -1;


}


return -1;


35. How would you find the second largest number in an array?
Loop through the array.
If the value of i is greater than the highest, store the value of i in highest, and store the value of highest in the second-highest variable.
private static int findSecondHighest(int[] array) {


    int highest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;


    int secondHighest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;


    for (int i : array) {


        if (i > highest) {


            secondHighest = highest;


            highest = i;


        } else if (i > secondHighest) {


            secondHighest = i;


        }


    }


    return secondHighest;


}


36. How do you remove all occurrences of a given character from the input string?
Use the built-in string method “replace” to replace a character with any other character, including symbols and white spaces.
String str1 = ""Australia"";


str1 = str1.replace(""a"", """");


System.out.println(str1); // ustrli


37. Showcase Inheritance with the help of a program?
The class Cat inherits the property color from the class Animal by extending the parent class (Animal).
This way a class Cat can have more parent classes if it wishes to inherit their properties.
class Animal {


    String color;


}


class Cat extends Animal {


    void meow() {


        System.out.println(""Meow"");


    }


}


38. Explain overloading and overriding with the help of a program?
Overloading:


When a class has two or more methods with the same name, they are called overloaded methods.


class Foo {


    void print(String s) {


        System.out.println(s);


    }


    void print(String s, int count) {


        while (count > 0) {


            System.out.println(s);


            count--;


        }


    }


}


Overriding:


When a superclass method is also implemented in the child class, it’s a case of overriding.


class Base {


    void printName() {


        System.out.println(""Base Class"");


    }


}


class Child extends Base {


    @Override


    void printName() {


        System.out.println(""Child Class"");


    }


}




39. How do you check if the given number is prime?
Use if statements to check for each condition separately:
If the number is 0 or 1, it cannot be prime.
If the number is 2, it is prime number.
If the number is indivisible by other numbers, it is prime.
public static boolean isPrime(int n) {


    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {


        return false;


    }


    if (n == 2) {


        return true;


    }


    for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; i++) {


        if (n % i == 0) {


            return false;


        }


    }


    return true;


}




40. How do you sum all the elements in an array?
Use for loop to iterate through the array and keep adding the elements in that array.
int[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };


int sum = 0;

Interview_Answers,Top Embedded Software Engineer Interview Questions You Should Learn,"﻿Q1. What is an embedded system?
An embedded system is a computer system with hardware and software components designed to serve a dedicated function. For example, a smoke detector (fire alarm) can be considered an embedded system. It is made of hardware (sensors, speaker, etc.) and software that starts the alarm when the smoke is detected via sensors. 


An embedded system could be designed to work as an independent system or as part of a large system. The smoke detector could be an example of an independent system. We can find several embedded systems in consumer electronics, automobiles, smart watches, household appliances, industrial equipment, and medical equipment.


Let’s understand the basic structure of an embedded system using a fire alarm: 


Sensor: The sensors (heat, smoke, or carbon monoxide sensors) measure and convert the physical quantity to an electrical signal.
A-D Converter: To convert the analog signal sent by the sensor into a digital signal.
Processor & ASICs: Processor and other ASICs run the instructions programmed to the fire alarm and process the sensor data by checking the values with the reference/threshold value to produce a suitable output (or no output). 
D-A Converter: To change the digital data fed by the processor to an analog signal. The actuators often require analog signals. 
Actuator: As directed by the output data from the processor, the actuator produces a physical signal, such as setting off the alarm, blinking LEDs, etc.
Q2. What is a spinlock?
Spinlock is a synchronization mechanism used to access shared resources orderly by locking resources for a short amount. At the same time, other consumers wait in a spin (loop) until the shared resource is released/unlocked. For example, two threads named Thread-A and Thread-B would like to access a common resource named Resource-X.  


Let's say Thread-A requests spinlock to access a Resource-X:


If Thread-B is using Resource-X, Thread-A will be waiting in a loop until Thread-B releases/unlocks Resource-X. 


If any thread does not use Resource-X, Thread-A will be allowed to acquire the spinlock, and all other threads will wait until Thread-A releases the lock. 


A spinlock is a lock that causes a thread trying to acquire it to simply wait in a loop (""spin"") while repeatedly checking whether the lock is available. 


Because the thread is not performing any task despite being active, the use of this lock puts the thread in a busy waiting state. Spinlock held until explicitly released. However, in some implementations, spinlocks may be automatically released if the thread being waited on “goes to sleep” or blocks. Spinlock is useful in a multiprocessor system.


Q3. What do we mean by virtual memory?
Virtual memory is a memory addressing scheme that offers the illusion of having one large continuous addressing space for an application. Physically, the main memory can be smaller than the virtual memory address. Some virtual memory addresses physically correspond to the main memory, and other addresses physically correspond to the secondary memory. 


There will be address translator implementation for the application to utilize one large contiguous address space. The address translation introduces an uncertain delay in the memory response. As a result, many embedded system microcontrollers do not implement virtual memory. 


Virtual memory allows users to load multiple bigger-size processors than in the main memory. Now the operating system does not load complete processes into the memory; rather, it loads the different relevant parts of multiple processors into the main memory. Thus effectively using the memory and also increasing the CPU utilization between processes. The size of the virtual memory is determined by the addressing scheme of the given CPU instruction architecture and not by the size of the main memory.




Virtual memory is implemented using both software as well as hardware. It maps memory addresses that a program uses, known as virtual addresses, to physical addresses in the computer's memory. All of a process's memory references are virtual or logical addresses. These logical addresses are then dynamically translated to physical addresses during run time.


Q4. What is your approach for debugging any issue in an embedded system?
Debugging techniques are very specific to the issue and the system. However, the following is a generic step-by-step approach that can be applied to most embedded systems. 


1. Understand the system


Understanding the system is always a good idea as it helps a lot in narrowing down the issue. You can start by asking a few basic questions, such as:


What is the input to the system? 
What is the hardware underneath? 
What is the expected behavior from the system?
What are the different states of the system (at a very high level)?
Questions such as these can save a lot of time at various stages during debugging. 


2. Reproduce the issue


Once you have a basic understanding of the system, you should try reproducing the issue. Hopefully, it is an issue that can be easily reproduced. If you can do these first two steps properly, finding the issue or debugging it becomes much easier. 


3. Add instrumentation/logging


Once you can reduce the issue, the next step is to see if it's easy or hard to reproduce the issue. If it's an easy-to-reproduce issue, then you don't worry too much about what are certain scenarios during which you can reproduce the issue. But if it is hard to reproduce the issue, then sometimes just seeing when the issue reproduces usually gives you a clue. 


In either of these cases, it is essential to add logging, some debug information, or add instrumentation (Oscilloscope, Signal Generator, Multimeter, etc.), depending on your system. 


Now, tracking through the sequences of steps becomes much easier until the issue is reproduced. 


In some systems, it's possible that you don't even have access to the signals. In such scenarios, you can try to look through the crash logs. You can then analyze the signals from the instruments or logs for a better understanding of the issue. 


4. Isolate the bug/system 


After finding where the issue is coming from, you can try to isolate the system (sub-system). You can then use divide-and-conquer techniques such as binary search to figure out the point where the bug is getting introduced.


5. Apply quick fixes


With all the information you gathered, try to form some hypotheses: 


This is the bug
This is the module (sub-system) or line of code the bug is coming from
Under these conditions; I can reproduce the issue (these conditions are causing the issue)
So now you can try applying quick fixes to counter the bug and iteratively see if the issue is reproducing again with the conditions identified earlier. If everything is working correctly, you can commit the changes and consider the bug fixed.


Q5. Describe the role of the watchdog timer.
Many microcontrollers have the watchdog timer feature (usually implemented with specific dedicated hardware). It can be used to check if the software running on the microcontroller is hung. Microcontrollers are designed to be stable and durable. 


However, there are still many issues that can affect the stability of the hardware. An unhandled combination of software-side events may also occur. Both can cause microcontrollers to get ""stuck or hang"" either electrically or in an infinite loop in software.


A watchdog timer is a subsystem that must explicitly notify software that everything is running as expected at a certain time. If the watchdog is not receiving the expected notification, it will take some action, such as resetting the microcontroller or even the entire device. This is usually done periodically, and the watchdog timer will take action if it does not receive a notification after a configurable amount of time since the last notification.


Q6. What is a livelock, and how is it different from a deadlock?
First, let’s understand what a deadlock is. In a deadlock, you have two or more concurrent processes waiting for a resource, and one of the processes may be holding the resource. Assuming it's a unitary resource, one process is holding one resource, and the other is holding another resource, so they are both waiting for the other to release the resources while not letting the resources go from themself.


So, basically, in a deadlock, we have a ‘hold and wait’ type of situation between the two processes. Both processes are doing this; therefore, they are in an embrace in which neither will let go so that the wait will be forever - this is what we define as a deadlock situation.


A live lock is the opposite of that. Instead of waiting, the processes try to get a resource, but the process is courteous, so it differs from taking the resource. These processes are not waiting and are running parallel. It means you check if any other process is active, and you assume it will also ask for the same resource, so you differ and back off from using (getting hold of) the resources. So when two processes differ from using the resources out of courtesy that the other process may need, it puts them in a livelock situation.


The loop here is that both processes keep checking for other activity and backing off. Now because they are concurrent, this thing can go on for a long time. None of the threads makes any progress which means they are locked.


To summarize, a deadlock is you're holding and waiting for the resources. But in a livelock, you differ forever from the resource, assuming some other active process will need it.


We can imagine a real-life example of livelock is when two people meet in a narrow hallway, and each of them tries to be polite by moving aside to let the other person pass. Still, they end up swaying from side to side without actually passing the hallway as they repeatedly move the same way at the same time.

Q7. What are the causes of the interrupt legacy?
The first delay is usually caused by hardware: the interrupt request signal must be synchronous with the CPU clock. Depending on the synchronization logic, up to 3 CPU cycles may elapse before an interrupt request reaches the CPU core.


The CPU usually completes the current instruction, which may take several cycles. On most systems, the time-consuming instructions to get executed are divide, push-multiple, or memory-copy. In addition to the cycles required by the CPU, additional cycles are often required for memory accesses. On an ARM7 system, the STMDB SP!,{R0-R11, LR} instruction is typically a worst-case instruction consisting of 13 32-bit registers and takes 15 clock cycles.


The memory system might require additional cycles for wait states.


Upon completion of the current instruction, the CPU performs a mode switch or pushes registers on the stack. Modern processors such as ARM generally perform mode switching, which takes fewer CPU cycles than saving registers.


Pipeline fill: Most modern CPUs are pipelined. Instruction execution occurs at different stages of the pipeline. The instruction is executed when it reaches its final stage of the pipeline. Since the mode switch has flushed the pipeline, several more cycles are required to refill the pipeline.


Q8. What are static memory allocation and dynamic memory allocation?
Memory Allocation: Memory allocation is the process by which physical or virtual memory space is allocated to computer programs and services. It is done either before or during program execution. There are two types of memory allocation:


Static Memory Allocation: Static allocation means that the object is declared with a static storage class or has an external or internal reference. It is initialized only once before the program starts, and its lifetime is for the duration of the program's execution. An example of static memory allocation is a global and static variable.
Dynamic Memory Allocation: In C, many library functions, such as malloc, calloc or realloc, etc., are used for dynamic memory allocation. One problem with dynamically allocated memory is that the compiler doesn't destroy it itself; the user is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
These memory management functions return a pointer to the allocated memory block, and the returned pointer points to the starting address of the allocated memory block. If no space is available, a null pointer is returned.

C, C++, Embedded C Software Engineer Interview Questions
In your embedded software engineer interview, you can be asked specific questions on C, C++, and Embedded C, such as:


Q1. What are the type qualifiers in C Programming? 
It is a keyword applied to a data type, resulting in a qualified type. For example, const int is a qualified type representing a constant integer, whereas const is a type qualifier to specify that the value will not be changed. The following code declares a constant integer x and sets its value to 10. Now, if we attempt to change x’s value, the compiler will throw an error.  




const int x = 10;
Similarly, a volatile int is a qualified type representing a volatile integer, meaning its value can change by any external device or hardware. The following code declares a volatile integer y and set’s its initial value to 0, which can be modified.




volatile int y = 0;
As of 2014 and C11, there are the following four type-qualifiers in standard C: 


const (C89): The const keyword is compiler-enforced and says that the program cannot change the object’s value, making the object a nonmodifiable type.
volatile (C89): A variable with a volatile-qualified type may be modified in ways the implementation is unaware of, or it may have other unanticipated side effects. The volatile keyword indicates that a value may change between different accesses, even if it does not appear to be modified.
restrict (C99): This type of qualifier can be used in pointer declarations. By adding this type of qualifier, a programmer hints to the compiler that for the lifetime of the pointer, no other pointer will be used to access the object to which it points.
_Atomic (C11):  The latter has a private name to avoid clashing with user-defined names. _Atomic is used to avoid the race condition if more than one thread attempts to update a variable simultaneously.
Q2. What is the difference between a null pointer and a void pointer?
A null pointer is essentially a null value assigned to a pointer of any data type, while a null pointer is a data type that remains void until it is assigned a data type address.


The data type of a pointer is stored in the memory location to which the pointer points. If you are unsure of the type of data stored in a particular memory location, you must create a void pointer.


A null pointer does not contain a reference to any variable/value; it is NULL, making it a null pointer.


a void pointer is always of type void *


These pointers are mainly used for dynamic memory allocation using the malloc(), calloc(), and realloc() functions. Here, the reserved memory block is a pointer to an empty pointer, and when the pointer value is returned, it must be explicitly cast to the specific type required.


Q3. Explain the use of ‘volatile’ in Embedded C.
A volatile keyword is a type qualifier in C applied to a variable when declared. It tells the compiler the variable may be modified in ways unknown to the implementation or have other unknown side effects. As a result, the compiler cannot make any assumptions about the variable's value. The optimizer must reload the variable every time it reads the value rather than keeping a copy in a register.


Let's take a look at the syntax:


To declare a variable as volatile, you must put the volatile keyword before or after the data type while defining the variable. Look at the following two variable declarations for a volatile unsigned 8-bit integer variable:




volatile uint8_t a; 
uint8_t volatile b;
Now, it turns out that pointers to volatile variables are pretty common, 


You can also declare a pointer to a volatile variable. The following declarations declare v_pot to be a pointer to a volatile unsigned 8-bit integer:




volatile uint8_t * v_pot; 
uint8_t volatile * v_pot;
However, using a volatile pointer to non-volatile data is very rare; the following is the syntax for reference:




uint16_t * volatile v_pot;
If you really must have a volatile pointer to a volatile variable, the following is the syntax for your reference:




uint16_t volatile * volatile v_pot;
Q4. Why do we need infinite loops in embedded programming, and how do we code an infinite loop in Embedded C?
As the name suggests, infinite loops repeat indefinitely and never terminate as long as the program is alive. In most other types of programming, infinite loops are created by mistake and don’t have many use cases. However, this is not the case with embedded programming. 


Embedded systems are intended to run forever and serve a given task repeatedly. If the embedded system suddenly exits, it means it no longer serves the task it is designed for. If the embedded system completes a given task, it should go into a sleep mood instead of exiting altogether because the next time the task is needed, it should be able to wake up and resume the task.


This infinite loop contains the main instruction the embedded system should execute. You can take the Arduino program template, for example:




void setup(){
// This function is called once when the program starts. This is a good place to initialize the various hardware and software parameters. 
}
void loop(){
// The loop() function is called over and over and is the heart of most sketches. 
}
Now, let’s see how we create infinite loops in Embedded C. 


The following is the definition of the infinite for loop. Here we don’t mention any of the parameters for initialization, condition, or increment/decrement for the loop.


Now, we'll look at how to use a while loop to create an infinite loop. The infinite while loop is defined as shown below. Here we hard code the while condition to true.




while(true)  
{  
   // body of the loop..  
}
The do-while loop can also be used to create the infinite loop. The following is the syntax to create the infinite do-while loop. Here again, we hard code the while condition to true. 




do  
{  
    // body of the loop..  
}while(true);
Q5. What do sizeof(int) return on 32-bit and 64-bit machines?
According to the C-spec, an integer only needs to be able to represent this (-32767,32767) range of numbers. Essentially the C-spec only says that an integer has to be 16 bits or larger. But in practice, sizeof(int) will return you 4 bytes on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines.


In other words, The C standard only specifies a minimum range for integer types guaranteed to be supported. An int is guaranteed to be able to hold (-32767,32767), which requires 16 bits (2 bytes). However, implementations can go beyond that minimum, as we see that many modern compilers make int 32-bit, i.e., 4 bytes.


However, a long int might have a different size on a 32-bit or 64-bit machine. It is also possible that a long int might be different on Windows versus Linux machines. But on the other hand, long long int is consistently 64 bits but could be implemented as more.

Coding, Data Structure, Algorithm Embedded Software Engineer Interview Questions
These questions stated below are similar to the software engineer interview questions on coding, algorithms, and data structures. You can practice these for your embedded software engineering interview.


Q1. How would you use a linked list to test for a loop?
A linked list is one of the most important data structures to learn and understand while preparing for interviews. Having a good grasp of linked lists can be a plus point during interviews.


In the given problem, we are given a singly linked list that may contain a loop. We have to return true if the linked list contains a loop and vice-versa.


If the linked list contains a loop, the last node in the list will not be pointing to the NULL; instead, it will be pointing to another node in the list (it can also point to itself).




Given problem can be approached in multiple ways.


Hashing Approach:


This approach is very simple. In this approach, we use a hashtable and keep inserting nodes into it while traversing the linked list. If NULL is reached at any point, we return false, and the linked list does not contain a loop.


And if the following node in the chain of current nodes points to any of the previously stored nodes in the hashtable, then return true.




bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *temp=head; 
        sethashtable;
        while(temp!=NULL){
       //If this node is already present
 //in hashmap, you will encounter it for the second //time and it means there is a cycle
            if(hashtable.find(temp->next)!=hashtable.end()){
                return true;
            }
            else{
          // If we are seeing the node for
          // the first time, insert it in hash
                hashtable.insert(temp->next);
            }
            temp=temp->next;
        }
        return false;      
    }
Complexity Analysis: 


Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. Only one pass through the loop is needed.
Auxiliary space: O(n) since a hash table is used.
Floyd's Cycle Search Algorithm:


This fastest method uses two pointers - a fast pointer and a slow pointer to check if there is a loop in the linked list. A slow pointer advances one node, while a fast pointer advances two nodes at a time. If there is a loop in a linked list, the fast and slow pointers must meet at some point.










class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {        
                // if head is NULL then return false;
        if(head == NULL)
            return false;        
                // making two pointers fast and slow and assigning them to head
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *slow = head;        
                // till fast and fast-> next not reaches NULL
                // we will increment fast by 2 step and slow by 1 step
        while(fast != NULL && fast ->next != NULL)
        {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;                                    
                        // At the point if fast and slow are at same address
                        // this means a linked list has a cycle in it.
            if(fast == slow)
                return true;
        }        
                // if traversal reaches to NULL this means no cycle.
        return false;
    }
Q2. Reverse the given string S.


Solution:


Approach 1: A simple approach to solving this problem is to use two-pointers. Initiate one pointer at the beginning of the string and one at the end. Continue the swap operation until both pointers coincide.




void reverseString(string &s) { int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1; while (left < right) { char tmp = s[left]; s[left++] = s[right]; s[right--] = tmp; } }
This problem can also be solved using a recursive approach, where we return the last letter of the string until the size of the remaining string is greater than zero.




void reverseString(const string& str) {
  // store the size of the string
  size_t numOfChars = str.size();
  if(numOfChars == 1) {
    cout << str << endl;
  }
  else {
    cout << str[numOfChars - 1];
    // function recursion
    reverseString(str.substr(0, numOfChars - 1));
  }
}
Q3. Given an increasing array of unique integers and an integer target. Now the array is rotated clockwise by some unknown number of rotations. Find and return the index of the target in the final rotated array. If it is not present, then return -1.
Example One:




""arr"": [3, 4, 5, 1, 2],
""target"": 1


Output: 3
Example Two:




""arr"": [8, 10, 5, 6, 7],
""target"": 2


Output: -1
Solution:




‍‍


The simplistic solution to this problem is to linearly iterate on the array while determining whether the current element and the target element are equal.




int getElementIndex(vector array, int target) {
   int index = -1;
   for (int i = 0; i < array.size(); i++) {
       if (array[i] == target) {
           index = i;
       }
   }
   return index;
}
‍Analysis


Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Optimal Approach (With Binary Search): 


We can solve this problem optimally with a single recursive Binary Search. 


The array can be treated as two different sorted arrays. All we need to do is to find the point from where the array needs to be broken down into two different arrays.


To find that point, we can perform a binary search to find the only element greater than its next element.


After finding that point, we can apply binary search in both parts of the array to find the index of the key.






int findRotatedIndx (vector arr, int low, int high) {
   if (high >= low) {
       int mid = (high + low) / 2;
       if (mid != 0 && arr[mid - 1] > arr[mid]) {
           return mid - 1;
       } else if (arr[0] >= arr[mid]) {
           return findRotatedIndx (arr, low, mid - 1);
       } else {
           return findRotatedIndx (arr, mid + 1, high);
       }
   }
   return - 1;
}
int binarySearch (vector arr, int low, int high, int target) {
   if(high >= low) {
       int mid = (high + low) / 2;
       if (arr[mid] == target) {
           return mid;
       } else if(arr[mid] > target) {
           return binarySearch (arr, low, mid - 1, target);
       } else {
           return binarySearch (arr, mid + 1, high, target);
       }
   }
   return - 1;
}
int getElementIndex(vector array, int target) {
   int n = array.size();
   int rotatedIndx = findRotatedIndx (array, 0, n - 1); 
   //using the  function to find the pivot element
  
   if (rotatedIndx == -1) {
       return binarySearch (array, 0, n - 1, target); 
   // if the array is in ascending or descending order, 
   //then perform binary search on the entire array
///

Bit Manipulation Embedded Software Engineer Interview Questions
In your embedded software engineer interview, you can expect questions on bit manipulation. Here are some sample questions:


Q1. Return the integer in the range missing from the given nums array containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n].
Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,0,1]


Output: 2


Explanation: n = 3 because there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range as it does not appear in the array.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [0,1]


Output: 2


Explanation: n = 2 because there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range as it does not appear in the array.


Solution:


We are given distinct numbers with only one missing number in the range 1 to n (inclusive).


So we can write, sum of numbers in given array + missing number = (1 + 2 + ... + n - 1 + n) = (n * (n + 1)) / 2. Hence, the missing number = (n * (n + 1)) / 2 - sum of numbers in the given array.


Time complexity: O(N), as we are traversing along the array.




int missingNumber(vector& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
        // Sum of n natural numbers
    int Nsum = n * (n + 1)/2;         
    int sumOfnums  = 0;        
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
        sumOfnums += nums[i];
    }
    return Nsum - sumOfnums;
}
Another approach to solving this problem is using the XoR technique.
In this technique, we take two variables, X1 and X2:


X1 contains the XOR of all the values from 1 to N
X2 contains the XOR of all the values in the array
When XOR is applied on X1 and X2, the elements in both X1 and X2 cancel each other out, returning the missing element.






int MissingNo(int arr[], int n) {
  int x1 = arr[0];
  int x2 = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    x1 = x1 ^ arr[i];
  for (int i = 2; i <= n + 1; i++)
    x2 = x2 ^ i;
  return (x1 ^ x2);
}
Q2. Reverse bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
Example 1:




Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192; its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.


Example 2:




Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471; its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.


Solution: 


This is a very interesting problem in bit manipulation.


This problem can be approached by first taking a variable result and assigning its value to be 00000000000000000000000000000000 (32-bit integer).


Now, iteratively add the last bit of the given integer n to the result to come up with the reversed bits. Then the left-shift operator can be used on the result, and a right-shift operator on the given integer to continue with the rest of the bits. These steps should continue until all the bits are examined in the given integer, i.e., 32 times, since the given integer is a 32-bit integer.


class Solution { public: uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) { uint32_t result = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) { result <<= 1; //Shifts bit to the left to make space for the new bit result |= n & 1; // Adds the last bit of n to res n >>= 1; // Remove the last bit from n, so we can continue with the rest of the bits } return result; } };
Q3. Given array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue. Sort them in the order of red, white, and blue so that objects of the same color are adjacent. 
Let’s use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent red, white, and blue, respectively. This problem must be solved without using the library's sort function.


Examples :




Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]


Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]


Input: nums = [0]
Output: nums = [0]
This problem is a variation of the famous Dutch National Flag problem and is one of the most popular programming problems. This problem can be solved in multiple ways.


Solution 1: Sorting. Since the array contains only 3 integers, 0, 1, and 2, simply sorting the array would arrange the elements in increasing order.


Time Complexity: O(N*logN)
Space Complexity: O(1)


But this is not the expected solution here, and this can be done in one pass.


Solution 2: 3-Pointer Approach


In this approach, we will be using 3 pointers — low, mid, and high — to move around the values. The primary goal is to move all the 0s to the left and all the 2s to the right of the array. At the same time, all the 1s will remain in the middle of the array, and the array will be sorted. 


Algorithm: 


Start by initializing three-pointers.










 


These three steps repeat until mid<=high. By the end of this operation, all the 0s will be to the left of low, and all the 2s will be to the right of high.




class Solution {
public:    
    void sortColors(vector& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int low=0;
        int mid = 0;
        int high = n-1;
        while(mid<=high){
            switch(nums[mid]){
                case 0: swap(nums[low++],nums[mid++]);
                        break;
                case 1: mid++;
                        break;
                case 2: swap(nums[high--],nums[mid]);
                        break;                
            }
        }
    }
};
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)


Q4. How do you do a big endian to little endian conversion on the 1024-bit system?
The endianness applies to a variable or a field in memory. So you have an endianness for a short or an endianness for an int or an endianness for a long int. The endianness is always based on how large that data type or variable is in memory. 


So if you have a 1024-bit system, the code you would need to write to convert from little to big-endian is the same code that one would write to convert big to little on a 32-bit system. Nothing logically changes; the only difference is now we have 128 bytes as opposed to just 4 or 8 bytes that we were trying to reorder. The bit size (32, 64, or 1024) of our system is irrelevant regarding big and little endian conversion.


You could have a 32-bit system with a 64-bit variable, and that variable might get swapped back and forth between big-endian and little-endian. 


Now you take any approach to reserve the bit to convert from big to little endian. A naive solution code is presented below:




// uint1024_t - hypothetical byte in a 1024-bit system
uint1024_t reverse(uint32_t input){
      // 
        uint1024_t rv;
      //
        uint8_t *inp = (uint8_t*) &input;
        uint16_t *out = (uint8_t*) &rv;
        // reversing
        for(int i=0;i<128;i++){
                out[i] = inp[128-i];
        }
        return rv;
}

Interview_Answers,How to Answer the 64 toughest interview questions,"﻿Question 1 Tell me about yourself.
TRAPS: Beware, about 80% of all interviews begin with this “innocent” question. Many
candidates, unprepared for the question, skewer themselves by rambling, recapping
their life story, delving into ancient work history or personal matters.
BEST ANSWER: Start with the present and tell why you are well qualified for the
position. Remember that the key to all successful interviewing is to match your
qualifications to what the interviewer is looking for. In other words you must sell what the
buyer is buying. This is the single most important strategy in job hunting.
So, before you answer this or any question it's imperative that you try to uncover your
interviewer's greatest need, want, problem or goal.
To do so, make you take these two steps:
1. Do all the homework you can before the interview to uncover this person's wants
and needs (not the generalized needs of the industry or company)
2. As early as you can in the interview, ask for a more complete description of what
the position entails. You might say: “I have a number of accomplishments I'd like
to tell you about, but I want to make the best use of our time together and talk
directly to your needs. To help me do, that, could you tell me more about the
most important priorities of this position? All I know is what I (heard from the
recruiter, read in the classified ad, etc.)”
Then, ALWAYS follow-up with a second and possibly, third question, to draw out his
needs even more. Surprisingly, it's usually this second or third question that unearths
what the interviewer is most looking for.
You might ask simply, ""And in addition to that?..."" or, ""Is there anything else you see as
essential to success in this position?:
This process will not feel easy or natural at first, because it is easier simply to answer
questions, but only if you uncover the employer's wants and needs will your answers
make the most sense. Practice asking these key questions before giving your answers,
the process will feel more natural and you will be light years ahead of the other job
candidates you're competing with.
After uncovering what the employer is looking for, describe why the needs of this job
bear striking parallels to tasks you've succeeded at before. Be sure to illustrate with
specific examples of your responsibilities and especially your achievements, all of which
are geared to present yourself as a perfect match for the needs he has just described.






Question 2 What are your greatest strengths?
TRAPS: This question seems like a softball lob, but be prepared. You don't want to
come across as egotistical or arrogant. Neither is this a time to be humble.
BEST ANSWER: You know that your key strategy is to first uncover your interviewer's
greatest wants and needs before you answer questions. And from Question 1, you know
how to do this.
Prior to any interview, you should have a list mentally prepared of your greatest
strengths. You should also have, a specific example or two, which illustrates each
strength, an example chosen from your most recent and most impressive achievements.
You should, have this list of your greatest strengths and corresponding examples from
your achievements so well committed to memory that you can recite them cold after
being shaken awake at 2:30AM.
Then, once you uncover your interviewer's greatest wants and needs, you can choose
those achievements from your list that best match up.
As a general guideline, the 10 most desirable traits that all employers love to see in their
employees are:
1. A proven track record as an achiever...especially if your achievements match
up with the employer's greatest wants and needs.
2. Intelligence...management ""savvy"".
3. Honesty...integrity...a decent human being.
4. Good fit with corporate culture...someone to feel comfortable with...a team
player who meshes well with interviewer's team.
5. Likeability...positive attitude...sense of humor.
6. Good communication skills.
7. Dedication...willingness to walk the extra mile to achieve excellence.
8. Definiteness of purpose...clear goals.
9. Enthusiasm...high level of motivation.
10. Confident...healthy...a leader.
Question 3 What are your greatest weaknesses?
TRAPS: Beware - this is an eliminator question, designed to shorten the candidate list.
Any admission of a weakness or fault will earn you an “A” for honesty, but an “F” for the
interview.
PASSABLE ANSWER: Disguise a strength as a weakness.
Example: “I sometimes push my people too hard. I like to work with a sense of urgency
and everyone is not always on the same wavelength.”
Drawback: This strategy is better than admitting a flaw, but it's so widely used, it is
transparent to any experienced interviewer.






BEST ANSWER: (and another reason it's so important to get a thorough description of
your interviewer's needs before you answer questions): Assure the interviewer that you
can think of nothing that would stand in the way of your performing in this position with
excellence. Then, quickly review you strongest qualifications.
Example: “Nobody's perfect, but based on what you've told me about this position, I
believe I' d make an outstanding match. I know that when I hire people, I look for two
things most of all. Do they have the qualifications to do the job well, and the motivation
to do it well? Everything in my background shows I have both the qualifications and a
strong desire to achieve excellence in whatever I take on. So I can say in all honesty that
I see nothing that would cause you even a small concern about my ability or my strong
desire to perform this job with excellence.”
Alternate strategy (if you don't yet know enough about the position to talk about such a
perfect fit):
Instead of confessing a weakness, describe what you like most and like least, making
sure that what you like most matches up with the most important qualification for
success in the position, and what you like least is not essential.
Example: Let's say you're applying for a teaching position. “If given a choice, I like to
spend as much time as possible in front of my prospects selling, as opposed to shuffling
paperwork back at the office. Of course, I long ago learned the importance of filing
paperwork properly, and I do it conscientiously. But what I really love to do is sell (if your
interviewer were a sales manager, this should be music to his ears.)
Question 4 Tell me about something you did – or failed to do – that


you now feel a little ashamed of.


TRAPS: There are some questions your interviewer has no business asking, and this is
one. But while you may feel like answering, “none of your business,” naturally you can’t.
Some interviewers ask this question on the chance you admit to something, but if not, at
least they’ll see how you think on your feet.
Some unprepared candidates, flustered by this question, unburden themselves of guilt
from their personal life or career, perhaps expressing regrets regarding a parent,
spouse, child, etc. All such answers can be disastrous.
BEST ANSWER: As with faults and weaknesses, never confess a regret. But don’t
seem as if you’re stonewalling either.
Best strategy: Say you harbor no regrets, then add a principle or habit you practice
regularly for healthy human relations.
Example: Pause for reflection, as if the question never occurred to you. Then say, “You
know, I really can’t think of anything.” (Pause again, then add): “I would add that as a
general management principle, I’ve found that the best way to avoid regrets is to avoid
causing them in the first place. I practice one habit that helps me a great deal in this
regard. At the end of each day, I mentally review the day’s events and conversations to
take a second look at the people and developments I’m involved with and do a






doublecheck of what they’re likely to be feeling. Sometimes I’ll see things that do need
more follow-up, whether a pat on the back, or maybe a five minute chat in someone’s
office to make sure we’re clear on things...whatever.”
“I also like to make each person feel like a member of an elite team, like the Boston
Celtics or LA Lakers in their prime. I’ve found that if you let each team member know
you expect excellence in their performance...if you work hard to set an example
yourself...and if you let people know you appreciate and respect their feelings, you wind
up with a highly motivated group, a team that’s having fun at work because they’re
striving for excellence rather than brooding over slights or regrets.”
Question 5 Why are you leaving (or did you leave) this position?
TRAPS: Never badmouth your previous industry, company, board, boss, staff,
employees or customers. This rule is inviolable: never be negative. Any mud you hurl
will only soil your suit.
Especially avoid words like “personality clash”, “didn’t get along”, or others which cast a
shadow on your competence, integrity, or temperament.
BEST ANSWER:
(If you have a job presently)
If you’re not yet 100% committed to leaving your present post, don’t be afraid to say so.
Since you have a job, you are in a stronger position than someone who does not. But
don’t be coy either. State honestly what you’d be hoping to find in a new spot. Of
course, as stated often before, you answer will all the stronger if you have already
uncovered what this position is all about and you match your desires to it.
(If you do not presently have a job.)
Never lie about having been fired. It’s unethical – and too easily checked. But do try to
deflect the reason from you personally. If your firing was the result of a takeover,
merger, division wide layoff, etc., so much the better.
But you should also do something totally unnatural that will demonstrate consummate
professionalism. Even if it hurts , describe your own firing – candidly, succinctly and
without a trace of bitterness – from the company’s point-of-view, indicating that you
could understand why it happened and you might have made the same decision
yourself.
Your stature will rise immensely and, most important of all, you will show you are healed
from the wounds inflicted by the firing. You will enhance your image as first-class
management material and stand head and shoulders above the legions of firing victims
who, at the slightest provocation, zip open their shirts to expose their battle scars and
decry the unfairness of it all.
For all prior positions:
Make sure you’ve prepared a brief reason for leaving. Best reasons: more money,
opportunity, responsibility or growth.






Question 6 The “Silent Treatment”
TRAPS: Beware – if you are unprepared for this question, you will probably not handle
it right and possibly blow the interview. Thank goodness most interviewers don’t employ
it. It’s normally used by those determined to see how you respond under stress. Here’s
how it works:
You answer an interviewer’s question and then, instead of asking another, he just stares
at you in a deafening silence.
You wait, growing a bit uneasy, and there he sits, silent as Mt. Rushmore, as if he
doesn’t believe what you’ve just said, or perhaps making you feel that you’ve unwittingly
violated some cardinal rule of interview etiquette.
When you get this silent treatment after answering a particularly difficult question , such
as “tell me about your weaknesses”, its intimidating effect can be most disquieting, even
to polished job hunters.
Most unprepared candidates rush in to fill the void of silence, viewing prolonged,
uncomfortable silences as an invitation to clear up the previous answer which has
obviously caused some problem. And that’s what they do – ramble on, sputtering more
and more information, sometimes irrelevant and often damaging, because they are
suddenly playing the role of someone who’s goofed and is now trying to recoup. But
since the candidate doesn’t know where or how he goofed, he just keeps talking,
showing how flustered and confused he is by the interviewer’s unmovable silence.
BEST ANSWER: Like a primitive tribal mask, the Silent Treatment loses all it power to
frighten you once you refuse to be intimidated. If your interviewer pulls it, keep quiet
yourself for a while and then ask, with sincere politeness and not a trace of sarcasm, “Is
there anything else I can fill in on that point?” That’s all there is to it.
Whatever you do, don’t let the Silent Treatment intimidate you into talking a blue streak,
because you could easily talk yourself out of the position.
Question 7 Why should I hire you?
TRAPS: Believe it or not, this is a killer question because so many candidates are
unprepared for it. If you stammer or adlib you’ve blown it.
BEST ANSWER: By now you can see how critical it is to apply the overall strategy of
uncovering the employer’s needs before you answer questions. If you know the
employer’s greatest needs and desires, this question will give you a big leg up over other
candidates because you will give him better reasons for hiring you than anyone else is
likely to...reasons tied directly to his needs.
Whether your interviewer asks you this question explicitly or not, this is the most
important question of your interview because he must answer this question favorably in
is own mind before you will be hired. So help him out! Walk through each of the






position’s requirements as you understand them, and follow each with a reason why you
meet that requirement so well.
Example: “As I understand your needs, you are first and foremost looking for someone
who can manage the sales and marketing of your book publishing division. As you’ve
said you need someone with a strong background in trade book sales. This is where
I’ve spent almost all of my career, so I’ve chalked up 18 years of experience exactly in
this area. I believe that I know the right contacts, methods, principles, and successful
management techniques as well as any person can in our industry.”
“You also need someone who can expand your book distribution channels. In my prior
post, my innovative promotional ideas doubled, then tripled, the number of outlets selling
our books. I’m confident I can do the same for you.”
“You need someone to give a new shot in the arm to your mail order sales, someone
who knows how to sell in space and direct mail media. Here, too, I believe I have
exactly the experience you need. In the last five years, I’ve increased our mail order
book sales from $600,000 to $2,800,000, and now we’re the country’s second leading
marketer of scientific and medical books by mail.” Etc., etc., etc.,
Every one of these selling “couplets” (his need matched by your qualifications) is a
touchdown that runs up your score. IT is your best opportunity to outsell your
competition.
Question 8 Aren’t you overqualified for this position?
TRAPS: The employer may be concerned that you’ll grow dissatisfied and leave.
BEST ANSWER: As with any objection, don’t view this as a sign of imminent defeat.
It’s an invitation to teach the interviewer a new way to think about this situation, seeing
advantages instead of drawbacks.
Example: “I recognize the job market for what it is – a marketplace. Like any
marketplace, it’s subject to the laws of supply and demand. So ‘overqualified’ can be a
relative term, depending on how tight the job market is. And right now, it’s very tight. I
understand and accept that.”
“I also believe that there could be very positive benefits for both of us in this match.”
“Because of my unusually strong experience in ________________ , I could start to
contribute right away, perhaps much faster than someone who’d have to be brought
along more slowly.”
“There’s also the value of all the training and years of experience that other companies
have invested tens of thousands of dollars to give me. You’d be getting all the value of
that without having to pay an extra dime for it. With someone who has yet to acquire
that experience, he’d have to gain it on your nickel.”






“I could also help you in many things they don’t teach at the Harvard Business School.
For example...(how to hire, train, motivate, etc.) When it comes to knowing how to work
well with people and getting the most out of them, there’s just no substitute for what you
learn over many years of front-line experience. You company would gain all this, too.”
“From my side, there are strong benefits, as well. Right now, I am unemployed. I want
to work, very much, and the position you have here is exactly what I love to do and am
best at. I’ll be happy doing this work and that’s what matters most to me, a lot more that
money or title.”
“Most important, I’m looking to make a long term commitment in my career now. I’ve had
enough of job-hunting and want a permanent spot at this point in my career. I also know
that if I perform this job with excellence, other opportunities cannot help but open up for
me right here. In time, I’ll find many other ways to help this company and in so doing,
help myself. I really am looking to make a long-term commitment.”
NOTE: The main concern behind the “overqualified” question is that you will leave your
new employer as soon as something better comes your way. Anything you can say to
demonstrate the sincerity of your commitment to the employer and reassure him that
you’re looking to stay for the long-term will help you overcome this objection.
Question 9 Where do you see yourself five years from now?
TRAPS: One reason interviewers ask this question is to see if you’re settling for this
position, using it merely as a stopover until something better comes along. Or they
could be trying to gauge your level of ambition.
If you’re too specific, i.e., naming the promotions you someday hope to win, you’ll sound
presumptuous. If you’re too vague, you’ll seem rudderless.
BEST ANSWER: Reassure your interviewer that you’re looking to make a long-term
commitment...that this position entails exactly what you’re looking to do and what you do
extremely well. As for your future, you believe that if you perform each job at hand with
excellence, future opportunities will take care of themselves.
Example: “I am definitely interested in making a long-term commitment to my next
position. Judging by what you’ve told me about this position, it’s exactly what I’m looking
for and what I am very well qualified to do. In terms of my future career path, I’m
confident that if I do my work with excellence, opportunities will inevitable open up for
me. It’s always been that way in my career, and I’m confident I’ll have similar
opportunities here.”






Question 10 Describe your ideal company, location and job.
TRAPS: This is often asked by an experienced interviewer who thinks you may be
overqualified, but knows better than to show his hand by posing his objection directly.
So he’ll use this question instead, which often gets a candidate to reveal that, indeed, he
or she is looking for something other than the position at hand.
BEST ANSWER: The only right answer is to describe what this company is offering,
being sure to make your answer believable with specific reasons, stated with sincerity,
why each quality represented by this opportunity is attractive to you.
Remember that if you’re coming from a company that’s the leader in its field or from a
glamorous or much admired company, industry, city or position, your interviewer and his
company may well have an “Avis” complex. That is, they may feel a bit defensive about
being “second best” to the place you’re coming from, worried that you may consider
them bush league.
This anxiety could well be there even though you’ve done nothing to inspire it. You must
go out of your way to assuage such anxiety, even if it’s not expressed, by putting their
virtues high on the list of exactly what you’re looking for, providing credible reason for
wanting these qualities.
If you do not express genuine enthusiasm for the firm, its culture, location, industry, etc.,
you may fail to answer this “Avis” complex objection and, as a result, leave the
interviewer suspecting that a hot shot like you, coming from a Fortune 500 company in
New York, just wouldn’t be happy at an unknown manufacturer based in Topeka,
Kansas.
Question 11 Why do you want to work at our company?
TRAPS: This question tests whether you’ve done any homework about the firm. If you
haven’t, you lose. If you have, you win big.
BEST ANSWER: This question is your opportunity to hit the ball out of the park, thanks
to the in-depth research you should do before any interview.
Best sources for researching your target company: annual reports, the corporate
newsletter, contacts you know at the company or its suppliers, advertisements, articles
about the company in the trade press.
Question 12 What are your career options right now?
TRAPS: The interviewer is trying to find out, “How desperate are you?”
BEST ANSWER: Prepare for this question by thinking of how you can position yourself
as a desired commodity. If you are still working, describe the possibilities at your
present firm and why, though you’re greatly appreciated there, you’re looking for
something more (challenge, money, responsibility, etc.). Also mention that you’re
seriously exploring opportunities with one or two other firms.




If you’re not working, you can talk about other employment possibilities you’re actually
exploring. But do this with a light touch, speaking only in general terms. You don’t want
to seem manipulative or coy.
Question 13 Why have you been out of work so long?
TRAPS: A tough question if you’ve been on the beach a long time. You don’t want to
seem like damaged goods.
BEST ANSWER: You want to emphasize factors which have prolonged your job search
by your own choice.
Example: “After my job was terminated, I made a conscious decision not to jump on the
first opportunities to come along. In my life, I’ve found out that you can always turn a
negative into a positive IF you try hard enough. This is what I determined to do. I
decided to take whatever time I needed to think through what I do best, what I most want
to do, where I’d like to do it...and then identify those companies that could offer such an
opportunity.”
“Also, in all honesty, you have to factor in the recession (consolidation, stabilization, etc.)
in the (banking, financial services, manufacturing, advertising, etc.) industry.”
“So between my being selective and the companies in our industry downsizing, the
process has taken time. But in the end, I’m convinced that when I do find the right
match, all that careful evaluation from both sides of the desk will have been well
worthwhile for both the company that hires me and myself.
Question 14 Tell me honestly about the strong points and weak
points of your boss (company, management team,
etc.)...


TRAPS: Skillfull interviewers sometimes make it almost irresistible to open up and air a
little dirty laundry from your previous position. DON’T
BEST ANSWER: Remember the rule: Never be negative. Stress only the good points,
no matter how charmingly you’re invited to be critical.
Your interviewer doesn’t care a whit about your previous boss. He wants to find out how
loyal and positive you are, and whether you’ll criticize him behind his back if pressed to
do so by someone in this own company. This question is your opportunity to
demonstrate your loyalty to those you work with.




Question 15 What good books have you read lately?
TRAPS: As in all matters of your interview, never fake familiarity you don’t have. Yet
you don’t want to seem like a dullard who hasn’t read a book since Tom Sawyer.
BEST ANSWER: Unless you’re up for a position in academia or as book critic for The
New York Times, you’re not expected to be a literary lion. But it wouldn’t hurt to have
read a handful of the most recent and influential books in your profession and on
management.
Consider it part of the work of your job search to read up on a few of these leading
books. But make sure they are quality books that reflect favorably upon you, nothing
that could even remotely be considered superficial. Finally, add a recently published
bestselling work of fiction by a world-class author and you’ll pass this question with flying
colors.
Question 16 Tell me about a situation when your work was


criticized.


TRAPS: This is a tough question because it’s a more clever and subtle way to get you
to admit to a weakness. You can’t dodge it by pretending you’ve never been criticized.
Everybody has been. Yet it can be quite damaging to start admitting potential faults and
failures that you’d just as soon leave buried.
This question is also intended to probe how well you accept criticism and direction.
BEST ANSWERS: Begin by emphasizing the extremely positive feedback you’ve gotten
throughout your career and (if it’s true) that your performance reviews have been
uniformly excellent.
Of course, no one is perfect and you always welcome suggestions on how to improve
your performance. Then, give an example of a not-too-damaging learning experience
from early in your career and relate the ways this lesson has since helped you. This
demonstrates that you learned from the experience and the lesson is now one of the
strongest breastplates in your suit of armor.
If you are pressed for a criticism from a recent position, choose something fairly trivial
that in no way is essential to your successful performance. Add that you’ve learned from
this, too, and over the past several years/months, it’s no longer an area of concern
because you now make it a regular practice to...etc.
Another way to answer this question would be to describe your intention to broaden your
master of an area of growing importance in your field. For example, this might be a
computer program you’ve been meaning to sit down and learn... a new management
technique you’ve read about...or perhaps attending a seminar on some cutting-edge
branch of your profession.
Again, the key is to focus on something not essential to your brilliant performance but
which adds yet another dimension to your already impressive knowledge base.




Question 17 What are your outside interests?
TRAPS: You want to be a well-rounded, not a drone. But your potential employer
would be even more turned off if he suspects that your heavy extracurricular load will
interfere with your commitment to your work duties.
BEST ANSWERS: Try to gauge how this company’s culture would look upon your
favorite outside activities and be guided accordingly.
You can also use this question to shatter any stereotypes that could limit your chances.
If you’re over 50, for example, describe your activities that demonstrate physical
stamina. If you’re young, mention an activity that connotes wisdom and institutional
trust, such as serving on the board of a popular charity.
But above all, remember that your employer is hiring your for what you can do for him,
not your family, yourself or outside organizations, no matter how admirable those
activities may be.
Question 18 The “Fatal Flaw” question
TRAPS: If an interviewer has read your resume carefully, he may try to zero in on a
“fatal flaw” of your candidacy, perhaps that you don’t have a college degree...you’ve
been out of the job market for some time...you never earned your CPA, etc.
A fatal flaw question can be deadly, but usually only if you respond by being overly
defensive.
BEST ANSWERS: As every master salesperson knows, you will encounter objections
(whether stated or merely thought) in every sale. They’re part and parcel of the buyer’s
anxiety. The key is not to exacerbate the buyer’s anxiety but diminish it. Here’s how...
Whenever you come up against a fatal flaw question:
1. Be completely honest, open and straightforward about admitting the
shortcoming. (Showing you have nothing to hide diminishes the buyer’s
anxiety.)
2. Do not apologize or try to explain it away. You know that this supposed flaw
is nothing to be concerned about, and this is the attitude you want your
interviewer to adopt as well.
3. Add that as desirable as such a qualification might be, its lack has made you
work all the harder throughout your career and has not prevented you from
compiling an outstanding tack record of achievements. You might even give
examples of how, through a relentless commitment to excellence, you have
consistently outperformed those who do have this qualification.
Of course, the ultimate way to handle “fatal flaw” questions is to prevent them from
arising in the first place. You will do that by following the master strategy described in
Question 1, i.e., uncovering the employers needs and them matching your qualifications
to those needs.


Once you’ve gotten the employer to start talking about his most urgently-felt wants and
goals for the position, and then help him see in step-by-step fashion how perfectly your
background and achievements match up with those needs, you’re going to have one
very enthusiastic interviewer on your hands, one who is no longer looking for “fatal
flaws”.
Question 19 How do you feel about reporting to a younger person


(minority, woman, etc)?


TRAPS: It’s a shame that some interviewers feel the need to ask this question, but
many understand the reality that prejudices still exist among some job candidates, and
it’s better to try to flush them out beforehand.
The trap here is that in today’s politically sensitized environment, even a well-intentioned
answer can result in planting your foot neatly in your mouth. Avoid anything which
smacks of a patronizing or an insensitive attitude, such as “I think they make terrific
bosses” or “Hey, some of my best friends are...”
Of course, since almost anyone with an IQ above room temperature will at least try to
steadfastly affirm the right answer here, your interviewer will be judging your sincerity
most of all. “Do you really feel that way?” is what he or she will be wondering.
So you must make your answer believable and not just automatic. If the firm is wise
enough to have promoted peopled on the basis of ability alone, they’re likely quite proud
of it, and prefer to hire others who will wholeheartedly share their strong sense of fair
play.
BEST ANSWER: You greatly admire a company that hires and promotes on merit alone
and you couldn’t agree more with that philosophy. The age (gender, race, etc.) of the
person you report to would certainly make no difference to you.
Whoever has that position has obviously earned it and knows their job well. Both the
person and the position are fully deserving of respect. You believe that all people in a
company, from the receptionist to the Chairman, work best when their abilities, efforts
and feelings are respected and rewarded fairly, and that includes you. That’s the best
type of work environment you can hope to find.
Question 20 On confidential matters...
TRAPS: When an interviewer presses you to reveal confidential information about a
present or former employer, you may feel it’s a no-win situation. If you cooperate, you
could be judged untrustworthy. If you don’t, you may irritate the interviewer and seem
obstinate, uncooperative or overly suspicious.
BEST ANSWER: Your interviewer may press you for this information for two reasons.
First, many companies use interviews to research the competition. It’s a perfect set-up.
Here in their own lair, is an insider from the enemy camp who can reveal prized
information on the competition’s plans, research, financial condition, etc.




Second, the company may be testing your integrity to see if you can be cajoled or bullied
into revealing confidential data.
What to do? The answer here is easy. Never reveal anything truly confidential about a
present or former employer. By all means, explain your reticence diplomatically. For
example, “I certainly want to be as open as I can about that. But I also wish to respect
the rights of those who have trusted me with their most sensitive information, just as you
would hope to be able to trust any of your key people when talking with a competitor...”
And certainly you can allude to your finest achievements in specific ways that don’t
reveal the combination to the company safe.
But be guided by the golden rule. If you were the owner of your present company, would
you feel it ethically wrong for the information to be given to your competitors? If so,
steadfastly refuse to reveal it.
Remember that this question pits your desire to be cooperative against your integrity.
Faced with any such choice, always choose integrity. It is a far more valuable
commodity than whatever information the company may pry from you. Moreover, once
you surrender the information, your stock goes down. They will surely lose respect for
you.
One President we know always presses candidates unmercifully for confidential
information. If he doesn’t get it, he grows visibly annoyed, relentlessly inquisitive, It’s all
an act. He couldn’t care less about the information. This is his way of testing the
candidate’s moral fiber. Only those who hold fast are hired.
Question 21 Would you lie for the company?
TRAPS: This another question that pits two values against one another, in this case
loyalty against integrity.
BEST ANSWER: Try to avoid choosing between two values, giving a positive statement
which covers all bases instead.
Example: “I would never do anything to hurt the company..”
If aggressively pressed to choose between two competing values, always choose
personal integrity. It is the most prized of all values.
Question 22 Looking back, what would you do differently in your


life?


TRAPS: This question is usually asked to uncover any life-influencing mistakes, regrets,
disappointments or problems that may continue to affect your personality and
performance.






You do not want to give the interviewer anything negative to remember you by, such as
some great personal or career disappointment, even long ago, that you wish could have
been avoided.
Nor do you wish to give any answer which may hint that your whole heart and soul will
not be in your work.
BEST ANSWER: Indicate that you are a happy, fulfilled, optimistic person and that, in
general, you wouldn’t change a thing.
Example: “It’s been a good life, rich in learning and experience, and the best it yet to
come. Every experience in life is a lesson it its own way. I wouldn’t change a thing.”
Question 23 Could you have done better in your last job?
TRAPS: This is no time for true confessions of major or even minor problems.
BEST ANSWER: Again never be negative.
Example: “I suppose with the benefit of hindsight you can always find things to do
better, of course, but off the top of my head, I can’t think of anything of major
consequence.”
(If more explanation seems necessary)
Describer a situation that didn’t suffer because of you but from external conditions
beyond your control.
For example, describe the disappointment you felt with a test campaign, new product
launch, merger, etc., which looked promising at first, but led to underwhelming results. “I
wish we could have known at the start what we later found out (about the economy
turning, the marketplace changing, etc.), but since we couldn’t, we just had to go for it.
And we did learn from it...”
Question 24 Can you work under pressure?
TRAPS: An easy question, but you want to make your answer believable.
BEST ANSWER: Absolutely...(then prove it with a vivid example or two of a goal or
project accomplished under severe pressure.)
Question 25 What makes you angry?
TRAPS: You don’t want to come across either as a hothead or a wimp.
BEST ANSWER: Give an answer that’s suited to both your personality and the
management style of the firm. Here, the homework you’ve done about the company and
its style can help in your choice of words.




Examples: If you are a reserved person and/or the corporate culture is coolly
professional:
“I’m an even-tempered and positive person by nature, and I believe this helps me a great
deal in keeping my department running smoothly, harmoniously and with a genuine
esprit de corps. I believe in communicating clearly what’s expected, getting people’s
commitment to those goals, and then following up continuously to check progress.”
“If anyone or anything is going off track, I want to know about it early. If, after that kind
of open communication and follow up, someone isn’t getting the job done, I’ll want to
know why. If there’s no good reason, then I’ll get impatient and angry...and take
appropriate steps from there. But if you hire good people, motivate them to strive for
excellence and then follow up constantly, it almost never gets to that state.”
If you are feisty by nature and/or the position calls for a tough straw boss.
“You know what makes me angry? People who (the fill in the blanks with the most
objectionable traits for this type of position)...people who don’t pull their own weight, who
are negative, people who lie...etc.”
Question 26 Why aren’t you earning more money at this stage of


your career?


TRAPS: You don’t want to give the impression that money is not important to you, yet
you want to explain why your salary may be a little below industry standards.
BEST ANSWER: You like to make money, but other factors are even more important.
Example: “Making money is very important to me, and one reason I’m here is because
I’m looking to make more. Throughout my career, what’s been even more important to
me is doing work I really like to do at the kind of company I like and respect.
(Then be prepared to be specific about what your ideal position and company would be
like, matching them as closely as possible to the opportunity at hand.
Question 27 Who has inspired you in your life and why?
TRAPS: The two traps here are unpreparedness and irrelevance. If you grope for an
answer, it seems you’ve never been inspired. If you ramble about your high school
basketball coach, you’ve wasted an opportunity to present qualities of great value to the
company.
BEST ANSWER: Have a few heroes in mind, from your mental “Board of Directors” –
Leaders in your industry, from history or anyone else who has been your mentor.
Be prepared to give examples of how their words, actions or teachings have helped
inspire your achievements. As always, prepare an answer which highlights qualities that
would be highly valuable in the position you are seeking.






Question 28 What was the toughest decision you ever had to


make?


TRAPS: Giving an unprepared or irrelevant answer.
BEST ANSWER: Be prepared with a good example, explaining why the decision was
difficult...the process you followed in reaching it...the courageous or effective way you
carried it out...and the beneficial results.
Question 29 Tell me about the most boring job you’ve ever had.
TRAPS: You give a very memorable description of a very boring job. Result? You
become associated with this boring job in the interviewer’s mind.
BEST ANSWER: You have never allowed yourself to grow bored with a job and you
can’t understand it when others let themselves fall into that rut.
Example: “Perhaps I’ve been fortunate, but that I’ve never found myself bored with any
job I have ever held. I’ve always enjoyed hard work. As with actors who feel there are
no small parts, I also believe that in every company or department there are exciting
challenges and intriguing problems crying out for energetic and enthusiastic solutions. If
you’re bored, it’s probably because you’re not challenging yourself to tackle those
problems right under your nose.”
Question 30 Have you been absent from work more than a few


days in any previous position?


TRAPS: If you’ve had a problem, you can’t lie. You could easily be found out. Yet
admitting an attendance problem could raise many flags.
BEST ANSWER: If you have had no problem, emphasize your excellent and consistent
attendance record throughout your career.
Also describe how important you believe such consistent attendance is for a key
executive...why it’s up to you to set an example of dedication...and why there’s just no
substitute for being there with your people to keep the operation running smoothly,
answer questions and handle problems and crises as they arise.
If you do have a past attendance problem, you want to minimize it, making it clear that it
was an exceptional circumstance and that it’s cause has been corrected.
To do this, give the same answer as above but preface it with something like, “Other that
being out last year (or whenever) because of (your reason, which is now in the past), I
have never had a problem and have enjoyed an excellent attendance record throughout
my career. Furthermore, I believe, consistent attendance is important because...” (Pick
up the rest of the answer as outlined above.).






Question 31 What changes would you make if you came on board?
TRAPS: Watch out! This question can derail your candidacy faster than a bomb on the
tracks – and just as you are about to be hired.
Reason: No matter how bright you are, you cannot know the right actions to take in a
position before you settle in and get to know the operation’s strengths, weaknesses key
people, financial condition, methods of operation, etc. If you lunge at this temptingly
baited question, you will probably be seen as someone who shoots from the hip.
Moreover, no matter how comfortable you may feel with your interviewer, you are still an
outsider. No one, including your interviewer, likes to think that a know-it-all outsider is
going to come in, turn the place upside down and with sweeping, grand gestures,
promptly demonstrate what jerks everybody’s been for years.
BEST ANSWER: You, of course, will want to take a good hard look at everything the
company is doing before making any recommendations.
Example: “Well, I wouldn’t be a very good doctor if I gave my diagnosis before the
examination. Should you hire me, as I hope you will, I’d want to take a good hard look at


everything you’re doing and understand why it’s being done that way. I’d like to have in-
depth meetings with you and the other key people to get a deeper grasp of what you feel


you’re doing right and what could be improved.
“From what you’ve told me so far, the areas of greatest concern to you are...” (name
them. Then do two things. First, ask if these are in fact his major concerns. If so then
reaffirm how your experience in meeting similar needs elsewhere might prove very
helpful).
Question 32 I’m concerned that you don’t have as much experience


as we’d like in...


TRAPS: This could be a make-or-break question. The interviewer mostly likes what he
sees, but has doubts over one key area. If you can assure him on this point, the job may
be yours.
BEST ANSWER: This question is related to “The Fatal Flaw” (Question 18), but here
the concern is not that you are totally missing some qualifications, such as CPA
certification, but rather that your experience is light in one area.
Before going into any interview, try to identify the weakest aspects of your candidacy
from this company’s point of view. Then prepare the best answer you possible can to
shore up your defenses.
To get past this question with flying colors, you are going to rely on your master strategy
of uncovering the employer’s greatest wants and needs and then matching them with
your strengths. Since you already know how to do this from Question 1, you are in a
much stronger position.






More specifically, when the interviewer poses as objection like this, you should...
1. Agree on the importance of this qualification.
2. Explain that your strength may be indeed be greater than your resume
indicates because...
3. When this strength is added to your other strengths, it’s really your
combination of qualifications that’s most important.


Then review the areas of your greatest strengths that match up most favorably with the
company’s most urgently-felt wants and needs.
This is powerful way to handle this question for two reasons. First, you’re giving your
interviewer more ammunition in the area of his concern. But more importantly, you’re
shifting his focus away from this one, isolated area and putting it on the unique
combination of strengths you offer, strengths which tie in perfectly with his greatest
wants.
Question 33 How do you feel about working nights and weekends?
TRAPS: Blurt out “no way, Jose” and you can kiss the job offer goodbye. But what if
you have a family and want to work a reasonably normal schedule? Is there a way to
get both the job and the schedule you want?
BEST ANSWER: First, if you’re a confirmed workaholic, this question is a softball lob.
Whack it out of the park on the first swing by saying this kind of schedule is just your
style. Add that your family understands it. Indeed, they’re happy for you, as they know
you get your greatest satisfaction from your work.
If however, you prefer a more balanced lifestyle, answer this question with another:
“What’s the norm for your best people here?”
If the hours still sound unrealistic for you, ask, “Do you have any top people who perform
exceptionally for you, but who also have families and like to get home in time to see
them at night?” Chances are this company does, and this associates you with this other
“top-performers-who-leave-not-later-than-six” group.
Depending on the answer, be honest about how you would fit into the picture. If all
those extra hours make you uncomfortable, say so, but phrase your response positively.
Example: “I love my work and do it exceptionally well. I think the results speak for
themselves, especially in ...(mention your two or three qualifications of greater interest
to the employer. Remember, this is what he wants most, not a workaholic with weak
credentials). Not only would I bring these qualities, but I’ve built my whole career on
working not just hard, but smart. I think you’ll find me one of the most productive people
here.
I do have a family who likes to see me after work and on weekends. They add balance
and richness to my life, which in turn helps me be happy and productive at work. If I
could handle some of the extra work at home in the evenings or on weekends, that






would be ideal. You’d be getting a person of exceptional productivity who meets your
needs with strong credentials. And I’d be able to handle some of the heavy workload at
home where I can be under the same roof as my family. Everybody would win.”
Question 34 Are you willing to relocate or travel?
TRAPS: Answer with a flat “no” and you may slam the door shut on this opportunity.
But what if you’d really prefer not to relocate or travel, yet wouldn’t want to lose the job
offer over it?
BEST ANSWER: First find out where you may have to relocate and how much travel
may be involved. Then respond to the question.
If there’s no problem, say so enthusiastically.
If you do have a reservation, there are two schools of thought on how to handle it.
One advises you to keep your options open and your reservations to yourself in the early
going, by saying, “no problem”. You strategy here is to get the best offer you can, then
make a judgment whether it’s worth it to you to relocate or travel.
Also, by the time the offer comes through, you may have other offers and can make a
more informed decision. Why kill of this opportunity before it has chance to blossom into
something really special? And if you’re a little more desperate three months from now,
you might wish you hadn’t slammed the door on relocating or traveling.
The second way to handle this question is to voice a reservation, but assert that you’d
be open to relocating (or traveling) for the right opportunity.
The answering strategy you choose depends on how eager you are for the job. If you
want to take no chances, choose the first approach.
If you want to play a little harder-to-get in hopes of generating a more enticing offer,
choose the second.
Question 35 Do you have the stomach to fire people? Have you


had experience firing many people?


TRAPS: This “innocent” question could be a trap door which sends you down a chute
and lands you in a heap of dust outside the front door. Why? Because its real intent is
not just to see if you’ve got the stomach to fire, but also to uncover poor judgment in
hiring which has caused you to fire so many. Also, if you fire so often, you could be a
tyrant.
So don’t rise to the bait by boasting how many you’ve fired, unless you’ve prepared to
explain why it was beyond your control, and not the result of your poor hiring procedures
or foul temperament.






BEST ANSWER: Describe the rational and sensible management process you follow
in both hiring and firing.
Example: “My whole management approach is to hire the best people I can find, train
them thoroughly and well, get them excited and proud to be part of our team, and then
work with them to achieve our goals together. If you do all of that right, especially hiring
the right people, I’ve found you don’t have to fire very often.
“So with me, firing is a last resort. But when it’s got to be done, it’s got to be done, and
the faster and cleaner, the better. A poor employee can wreak terrible damage in
undermining the morale of an entire team of good people. When there’s no other way,
I’ve found it’s better for all concerned to act decisively in getting rid of offenders who
won’t change their ways.”
Question 36 Why have you had so many jobs?
TRAPS: Your interviewer fears you may leave this position quickly, as you have others.
He’s concerned you may be unstable, or a “problem person” who can’t get along with
others.
BEST ANSWER: First, before you even get to the interview stage, you should try to
minimize your image as job hopper. If there are several entries on your resume of less
than one year, consider eliminating the less important ones. Perhaps you can specify
the time you spent at previous positions in rounded years not in months and years.
Example: Instead of showing three positions this way:
6/1982 – 3/1983, Position A;
4/1983 – 12/1983, Position B;
1/1984 – 8/1987, Position C;
...it would be better to show simply:
1982 – 1983, Position A;
1984 – 1987 Position C.
In other words, you would drop Position B altogether. Notice what a difference this
makes in reducing your image as a job hopper.
Once in front of the interviewer and this question comes up, you must try to reassure
him. Describe each position as part of an overall pattern of growth and career
destination.
Be careful not to blame other people for your frequent changes. But you can and should
attribute certain changes to conditions beyond your control.
Example: Thanks to an upcoming merger, you wanted to avoid an ensuing bloodbath,
so you made a good, upward career move before your department came under the axe
of the new owners.






If possible, also show that your job changes were more frequent in your younger days,
while you were establishing yourself, rounding out your skills and looking for the right
career path. At this stage in your career, you’re certainly much more interested in the
best long-term opportunity.
You might also cite the job(s) where you stayed the longest and describe that this type of
situation is what you’re looking for now.
Question 37 What do you see as the proper role/mission of...


...a good (job title you’re seeking);
...a good manager;
...an executive in serving the community;
...a leading company in our industry; etc.
TRAPS: These and other “proper role” questions are designed to test your
understanding of your place in the bigger picture of your department, company,
community and profession....as well as the proper role each of these entities should play
in its bigger picture.
The question is most frequently asked by the most thoughtful individuals and
companies...or by those concerned that you’re coming from a place with a radically
different corporate culture (such as from a big government bureaucracy to an aggressive
small company).
The most frequent mistake executives make in answering is simply not being prepared
(seeming as if they’ve never giving any of this a though.)...or in phrasing an answer best
suited to their prior organization’s culture instead of the hiring company’s.
BEST ANSWER: Think of the most essential ingredients of success for each category
above – your job title, your role as manager, your firm’s role, etc.
Identify at least three but no more than six qualities you feel are most important to
success in each role. Then commit your response to memory.
Here, again, the more information you’ve already drawn out about the greatest wants
and needs of the interviewer, and the more homework you’ve done to identify the culture
of the firm, the more on-target your answer will be.
Question 38 What would you say to your boss if he’s crazy about an


idea, but you think it stinks?


TRAPS: This is another question that pits two values, in this case loyalty and honesty,
against one another.
BEST ANSWER: Remember the rule stated earlier: In any conflict between values,
always choose integrity.






Example: I believe that when evaluating anything, it’s important to emphasize the
positive. What do I like about this idea?”
“Then, if you have reservations, I certainly want to point them out, as specifically,
objectively and factually as I can.”
“After all, the most important thing I owe my boss is honesty. If he can’t count on me for
that, then everything else I may do or say could be questionable in his eyes.”
“But I also want to express my thoughts in a constructive way. So my goal in this case
would be to see if my boss and I could make his idea even stronger and more appealing,
so that it effectively overcomes any initial reservation I or others may have about it.”
“Of course, if he overrules me and says, ‘no, let’s do it my way,’ then I owe him my full
and enthusiastic support to make it work as best it can.”
Question 39 How could you have improved your career progress?
TRAPS: This is another variation on the question, “If you could, how would you live your
life over?” Remember, you’re not going to fall for any such invitations to rewrite person
history. You can’t win if you do.
BEST ANSWER: You’re generally quite happy with your career progress. Maybe, if
you had known something earlier in life (impossible to know at the time, such as the
booming growth in a branch in your industry...or the corporate downsizing that would
phase out your last job), you might have moved in a certain direction sooner.
But all things considered, you take responsibility for where you are, how you’ve gotten
there, where you are going...and you harbor no regrets.
Question 40 What would you do if a fellow executive on your own
corporate level wasn’t pulling his/her weight...and this
was hurting your department?


TRAPS: This question and other hypothetical ones test your sense of human relations
and how you might handle office politics.
BEST ANSWER: Try to gauge the political style of the firm and be guided accordingly.
In general, fall back on universal principles of effective human relations – which in the
end, embody the way you would like to be treated in a similar circumstance.
Example: “Good human relations would call for me to go directly to the person and
explain the situation, to try to enlist his help in a constructive, positive solution. If I
sensed resistance, I would be as persuasive as I know how to explain the benefits we
can all gain from working together, and the problems we, the company and our
customers will experience if we don’t.”






POSSIBLE FOLLOW-UP QUESTION: And what would you do if he still did not change
his ways?
ANSWER: “One thing I wouldn’t do is let the problem slide, because it would only get
worse and overlooking it would set a bad precedent. I would try again and again and
again, in whatever way I could, to solve the problem, involving wider and wider circles of
people, both above and below the offending executive and including my own boss if
necessary, so that everyone involved can see the rewards for teamwork and the
drawbacks of non-cooperation.”
“I might add that I’ve never yet come across a situation that couldn’t be resolved by
harnessing others in a determined, constructive effort.”
Question 41 You’ve been with your firm a long time. Won’t it be


hard switching to a new company?


TRAPS: Your interviewer is worried that this old dog will find it hard to learn new tricks.
BEST ANSWER: To overcome this objection, you must point to the many ways you
have grown and adapted to changing conditions at your present firm. It has not been a
static situation. Highlight the different responsibilities you’ve held, the wide array of new
situations you’ve faced and conquered.
As a result, you’ve learned to adapt quickly to whatever is thrown at you, and you thrive
on the stimulation of new challenges.
To further assure the interviewer, describe the similarities between the new position and
your prior one. Explain that you should be quite comfortable working there, since their
needs and your skills make a perfect match.
Question 42 May I contact your present employer for a reference?
TRAPS: If you’re trying to keep your job search private, this is the last thing you want.
But if you don’t cooperate, won’t you seem as if you’re trying to hide something?
BEST ANSWER: Express your concern that you’d like to keep your job search private,
but that in time, it will be perfectly okay.
Example: “My present employer is not aware of my job search and, for obvious reasons;
I’d prefer to keep it that way. I’d be most appreciative if we kept our discussion
confidential right now. Of course, when we both agree the time is right, then by all
means you should contact them. I’m very proud of my record there.






Question 43 Give me an example of your creativity (analytical


skill...managing ability, etc.)


TRAPS: The worst offense here is simply being unprepared. Your hesitation may seem
as if you’re having a hard time remembering the last time you were creative, analytical,
etc.
BEST ANSWER: Remember from Question 2 that you should commit to memory a list
of your greatest and most recent achievements, ever ready on the tip of your tongue.
If you have such a list, it’s easy to present any of your achievements in light of the
quality the interviewer is asking about. For example, the smashing success you
orchestrated at last year’s trade show could be used as an example of creativity, or
analytical ability, or your ability to manage.
Question 44 Where could you use some improvement?
TRAPS: Another tricky way to get you to admit weaknesses. Don’t fall for it.
BEST ANSWER: Keep this answer, like all your answers, positive. A good way to
answer this question is to identify a cutting-edge branch of your profession (one that’s
not essential to your employer’s needs) as an area you’re very excited about and want to
explore more fully over the next six months.
Question 45 What do you worry about?
TRAPS: Admit to worrying and you could sound like a loser. Saying you never worry
doesn’t sound credible.
BEST ANSWER: Redefine the word ‘worry’ so that it does not reflect negatively on you.
Example: “I wouldn’t call it worry, but I am a strongly goal-oriented person. So I keep
turning over in my mind anything that seems to be keeping me from achieving those
goals, until I find a solution. That’s part of my tenacity, I suppose.”
Question 46 How many hours a week do you normally work?
TRAPS: You don’t want to give a specific number. Make it to low, and you may not
measure up. Too high, and you’ll forever feel guilty about sneaking out the door at 5:15.
BEST ANSWER: If you are in fact a workaholic and you sense this company would like
that: Say you are a confirmed workaholic, that you often work nights and weekends.
Your family accepts this because it makes you fulfilled.
If you are not a workaholic: Say you have always worked hard and put in long hours. It
goes with the territory. It one sense, it’s hard to keep track of the hours because your
work is a labor of love, you enjoy nothing more than solving problems. So you’re almost






always thinking about your work, including times when you’re home, while shaving in the
morning, while commuting, etc.
Question 47 What’s the most difficult part of being a (job title)?
TRAPS: Unless you phrase your answer properly, your interviewer may conclude that
whatever you identify as “difficult” is where you are weak.
BEST ANSWER: First, redefine “difficult” to be “challenging” which is more positive.
Then, identify an area everyone in your profession considers challenging and in which
you excel. Describe the process you follow that enables you to get splendid
results...and be specific about those results.
Example: “I think every sales manager finds it challenging to motivate the troops in a
recession. But that’s probably the strongest test of a top sales manager. I feel this is
one area where I excel.”
“When I see the first sign that sales may slip or that sales force motivation is flagging
because of a downturn in the economy, here’s the plan I put into action immediately...”
(followed by a description of each step in the process...and most importantly, the
exceptional results you’ve achieved.).
Question 48 The “Hypothetical Problem”
TRAPS: Sometimes an interviewer will describe a difficult situation and ask, “How
would you handle this?” Since it is virtually impossible to have all the facts in front of you
from such a short presentation, don’t fall into the trap of trying to solve this problem and
giving your verdict on the spot. It will make your decision-making process seem woefully
inadequate.
BEST ANSWER: Instead, describe the rational, methodical process you would follow in
analyzing this problem, who you would consult with, generating possible solutions,
choosing the best course of action, and monitoring the results.
Remember, in all such, “What would you do?” questions, always describe your process
or working methods, and you’ll never go wrong.
Question 49 What was the toughest challenge you’ve ever faced?
TRAPS: Being unprepared or citing an example from so early in your life that it doesn’t
score many points for you at this stage of your career.
BEST ANSWER: This is an easy question if you’re prepared. Have a recent example
ready that demonstrates either:
1. A quality most important to the job at hand; or
2. A quality that is always in demand, such as leadership, initiative, managerial skill,
persuasiveness, courage, persistence, intelligence, etc.






Question 50 Have you consider starting your own business?
TRAPS: If you say “yes” and elaborate enthusiastically, you could be perceived as a
loose cannon in a larger company, too entrepreneurial to make a good team player...or
someone who had to settle for the corporate life because you couldn’t make a go of your
own business.
Also too much enthusiasm in answering “yes” could rouse the paranoia of a small
company indicating that you may plan to go out on your own soon, perhaps taking some
key accounts or trade secrets with you.


On the other hand, if you answer “no, never” you could be perceived as a security-
minded drone who never dreamed a big dream.


BEST ANSWER: Again it’s best to:
1. Gauge this company’s corporate culture before answering and...
2. Be honest (which doesn’t mean you have to vividly share your fantasy of the
franchise or bed-and-breakfast you someday plan to open).
In general, if the corporate culture is that of a large, formal, military-style structure,
minimize any indication that you’d love to have your own business. You might say, “Oh,
I may have given it a thought once or twice, but my whole career has been in larger
organizations. That’s where I have excelled and where I want to be.”
If the corporate culture is closer to the free-wheeling, everybody’s-a-deal-maker variety,
then emphasize that in a firm like this, you can virtually get the best of all worlds, the
excitement of seeing your own ideas and plans take shape...combined with the
resources and stability of a well-established organization. Sounds like the perfect
environment to you.
In any case, no matter what the corporate culture, be sure to indicate that any desires
about running your own show are part of your past, not your present or future.
The last thing you want to project is an image of either a dreamer who failed and is now
settling for the corporate cocoon...or the restless maverick who will fly out the door with
key accounts, contacts and trade secrets under his arms just as soon as his bankroll has
gotten rebuilt.
Always remember: Match what you want with what the position offers. The more
information you’ve uncovered about the position, the more believable you can make your
case.






Question 51 What are your goals?
TRAPS: Not having any...or having only vague generalities, not highly specific goals.


BEST ANSWER: Many executives in a position to hire you are strong believers in goal-
setting. (It’s one of the reason they’ve achieved so much). They like to hire in kind.


If you’re vague about your career and personal goals, it could be a big turnoff to may
people you will encounter in your job search.
Be ready to discuss your goals for each major area of your life: career, personal
development and learning, family, physical (health), community service and (if your
interviewer is clearly a religious person) you could briefly and generally allude to your
spiritual goals (showing you are a well-rounded individual with your values in the right
order).
Be prepared to describe each goal in terms of specific milestones you wish to
accomplish along the way, time periods you’re allotting for accomplishment, why the
goal is important to you, and the specific steps you’re taking to bring it about. But do this
concisely, as you never want to talk more than two minutes straight before letting your
interviewer back into the conversation.
Question 52 What do you for when you hire people?
TRAPS: Being unprepared for the question.
BEST ANSWER: Speak your own thoughts here, but for the best answer weave them
around the three most important qualifications for any position.
1. Can the person do the work (qualifications)?
2. Will the person do the work (motivation)?
3. Will the person fit in (“our kind of team player”)?
Question 53 Sell me this stapler...(this pencil...this clock...or some


other object on interviewer’s desk).


TRAPS: Some interviewers, especially business owners and hard-changing executives
in marketing-driven companies, feel that good salesmanship is essential for any key
position and ask for an instant demonstration of your skill. Be ready.
BEST ANSWER: Of course, you already know the most important secret of all great
salesmanship – “find out what people want, then show them how to get it.”
If your interviewer picks up his stapler and asks, “sell this to me,” you are going to
demonstrate this proven master principle. Here’s how:






“Well, a good salesman must know both his product and his prospect before he sells
anything. If I were selling this, I’d first get to know everything I could about it, all its
features and benefits.”
“Then, if my goal were to sell it you, I would do some research on how you might use a
fine stapler like this. The best way to do that is by asking some questions. May I ask
you a few questions?”
Then ask a few questions such as, “Just out of curiosity, if you didn’t already have a
stapler like this, why would you want one? And in addition to that? Any other reason?
Anything else?”
“And would you want such a stapler to be reliable?...Hold a good supply of staples?”
(Ask more questions that point to the features this stapler has.)
Once you’ve asked these questions, make your presentation citing all the features and
benefits of this stapler and why it’s exactly what the interviewer just told you he’s looking
for.
Then close with, “Just out of curiosity, what would you consider a reasonable price for a
quality stapler like this...a stapler you could have right now and would (then repeat all
the problems the stapler would solve for him)? Whatever he says, (unless it’s zero), say,
“Okay, we’ve got a deal.”
NOTE: If your interviewer tests you by fighting every step of the way, denying that he
even wants such an item, don’t fight him. Take the product away from him by saying,
“Mr. Prospect, I’m delighted you’ve told me right upfront that there’s no way you’d ever
want this stapler. As you well know, the first rule of the most productive salespeople in
any field is to meet the needs of people who really need and want our products, and it
just wastes everyone’s time if we try to force it on those who don’t. And I certainly
wouldn’t want to waste your time. But we sell many items. Is there any product on this
desk you would very much like to own...just one item?” When he points something out,
repeat the process above. If he knows anything about selling, he may give you a
standing ovation.






Question 54 “The Salary Question” – How much money do you


want?


TRAPS: May also be phrases as, “What salary are you worth?”...or, “How much are
you making now?” This is your most important negotiation. Handle it wrong and you can
blow the job offer or go to work at far less than you might have gotten.
BEST ANSWER: For maximum salary negotiating power, remember these five
guidelines:
1. Never bring up salary. Let the interviewer do it first. Good salespeople sell their
products thoroughly before talking price. So should you. Make the interviewer
want you first, and your bargaining position will be much stronger.
2. If your interviewer raises the salary question too early, before you’ve had a
chance to create desire for your qualifications, postpone the question, saying
something like, “Money is important to me, but is not my main concern.
Opportunity and growth are far more important. What I’d rather do, if you don’t
mind, is explore if I’m right for the position, and then talk about money. Would
that be okay?”
3. The #1 rule of any negotiation is: the side with more information wins. After
you’ve done a thorough job of selling the interviewer and it’s time to talk salary,
the secret is to get the employer talking about what he’s willing to pay before you
reveal what you’re willing to accept. So, when asked about salary, respond by
asking, “I’m sure the company has already established a salary range for this
position. Could you tell me what that is?” Or, “I want an income commensurate
with my ability and qualifications. I trust you’ll be fair with me. What does the
position pay?” Or, more simply, “What does this position pay?”
4. Know beforehand what you’d accept. To know what’s reasonable, research the
job market and this position for any relevant salary information. Remember that
most executives look for a 20-25%$ pay boost when they switch jobs. If you’re
grossly underpaid, you may want more.
5. Never lie about what you currently make, but feel free to include the estimated
cost of all your fringes, which could well tack on 25-50% more to your present
“cash-only” salary.


Question 55 The Illegal Question
TRAPS: Illegal questions include any regarding your age...number and ages of your
children or other dependents...marital status...maiden name...religion...political
affiliation...ancestry...national origin...birthplace...naturalization of your parents, spouse
or children...diseases...disabilities...clubs...or spouse’s occupation...unless any of the
above are directly related to your performance of the job. You can’t even be asked
about arrests, though you can be asked about convictions.
BEST ANSWER: Under the ever-present threat of lawsuits, most interviewers are well
aware of these taboos. Yet you may encounter, usually on a second or third interview, a
senior executive who doesn’t interview much and forgets he can’t ask such questions.






You can handle an illegal question in several ways. First, you can assert your legal right
not to answer. But this will frighten or embarrass your interviewer and destroy any
rapport you had.
Second, you could swallow your concerns over privacy and answer the question straight
forwardly if you feel the answer could help you. For example, your interviewer, a devout
Baptist, recognizes you from church and mentions it. Here, you could gain by talking
about your church.
Third, if you don’t want your privacy invaded, you can diplomatically answer the concern
behind the question without answering the question itself.
Example: If you are over 50 and are asked, “How old are you?” you can answer with a
friendly, smiling question of your own on whether there’s a concern that your age my
affect your performance. Follow this up by reassuring the interviewer that there’s
nothing in this job you can’t do and, in fact, your age and experience are the most
important advantages you offer the employer for the following reasons...
Another example: If asked, “Do you plan to have children?” you could answer, “I am
wholeheartedly dedicated to my career“, perhaps adding, “I have no plans regarding
children.” (You needn’t fear you’ve pledged eternal childlessness. You have every right
to change your plans later. Get the job first and then enjoy all your options.)
Most importantly, remember that illegal questions arise from fear that you won’t perform
well. The best answer of all is to get the job and perform brilliantly. All concerns and
fears will then varnish, replaced by respect and appreciation for your work.
Question 56 The “Secret” Illegal Question
TRAPS: Much more frequent than the Illegal question (see Question 55) is the secret
illegal question. It’s secret because it’s asked only in the interviewer’s mind. Since it’s
not even expressed to you, you have no way to respond to it, and it can there be most
damaging.
Example: You’re physically challenged, or a single mother returning to your professional
career, or over 50, or a member of an ethnic minority, or fit any of a dozen other
categories that do not strictly conform to the majority in a given company.
Your interviewer wonders, “Is this person really able to handle the job?”...”Is he or she a
‘good fit’ at a place like ours?”...”Will the chemistry ever be right with someone like this?”
But the interviewer never raises such questions because they’re illegal. So what can
you do?
BEST ANSWER: Remember that just because the interviewer doesn’t ask an illegal
question doesn’t mean he doesn’t have it. More than likely, he is going to come up with
his own answer. So you might as well help him out.






How? Well, you obviously can’t respond to an illegal question if he hasn’t even asked.
This may well offend him. And there’s always the chance he wasn’t even concerned
about the issue until you brought it up, and only then begins to wonder.
So you can’t address “secret” illegal questions head-on. But what you can do is make
sure there’s enough counterbalancing information to more than reassure him that there’s
no problem in the area he may be doubtful about.
For example, let’s say you’re a sales rep who had polio as a child and you need a cane
to walk. You know your condition has never impeded your performance, yet you’re
concerned that your interviewer may secretly be wondering about your stamina or ability
to travel. Well, make sure that you hit these abilities very hard, leaving no doubt about
your capacity to handle them well.
So, too, if you’re in any different from what passes for “normal”. Make sure, without in
any way seeming defensive about yourself that you mention strengths,
accomplishments, preferences and affiliations that strongly counterbalance any
unspoken concern your interviewer may have.
Question 57 What was the toughest part of your last job?
TRAPS: This is slightly different from the question raised earlier, “What’s the most
difficult part of being a (job title...)” because this asks what you personally have found
most difficult in your last position. This question is more difficult to redefine into
something positive. Your interviewer will assume that whatever you found toughest may
give you a problem in your new position.
BEST ANSWER: State that there was nothing in your prior position that you found
overly difficult, and let your answer go at that. If pressed to expand your answer, you
could describe the aspects of the position you enjoyed more than others, making sure
that you express maximum enjoyment for those tasks most important to the open
position, and you enjoyed least those tasks that are unimportant to the position at hand.
Question 58 How do you define success...and how do you measure


up to your own definition?


TRAPS: Seems like an obvious enough question. Yet many executives, unprepared for
it, fumble the ball.
BEST ANSWER: Give a well-accepted definition of success that leads right into your
own stellar collection of achievements.
Example: “The best definition I’ve come across is that success is the progressive
realization of a worthy goal.”
“As to how I would measure up to that definition, I would consider myself both successful
and fortunate...”(Then summarize your career goals and how your achievements have
indeed represented a progressive path toward realization of your goals.)






Question 59 “The Opinion Question” – What do you think about
...Abortion...The President...The Death Penalty...(or
any other controversial subject)?


TRAPS: Obviously, these and other “opinion” questions should never be asked.
Sometimes they come up over a combination dinner/interview when the interviewer has
had a drink or two, is feeling relaxed, and is spouting off about something that bugged
him in today’s news. If you give your opinion and it’s the opposite of his, you won’t
change his opinions, but you could easily lose the job offer.
BEST ANSWER: In all of these instances, just remember the tale about student and the
wise old rabbi. The scene is a seminary, where an overly serious student is pressing the
rabbi to answer the ultimate questions of suffering, life and death. But no matter how
hard he presses, the wise old rabbi will only answer each difficult question with a
question of his own.
In exasperation, the seminary student demands, “Why, rabbi, do you always answer a
question with another question?” To which the rabbi responds, “And why not?”
If you are ever uncomfortable with any question, asking a question in return is the
greatest escape hatch ever invented. It throws the onus back on the other person,
sidetracks the discussion from going into an area of risk to you, and gives you time to
think of your answer or, even better, your next question!
In response to any of the “opinion” questions cited above, merely responding, “Why do
you ask?” will usually be enough to dissipate any pressure to give your opinion. But if
your interviewer again presses you for an opinion, you can ask another question.
Or you could assert a generality that almost everyone would agree with. For example, if
your interviewer is complaining about politicians then suddenly turns to you and asks if
you’re a Republican or Democrat, you could respond by saying, “Actually, I’m finding it
hard to find any politicians I like these days.”
(Of course, your best question of all may be whether you want to work for someone
opinionated.)
Question 60 If you won $10 million lottery, would you still work?
TRAPS: Your totally honest response might be, “Hell, no, are you serious?” That might
be so, but any answer which shows you as fleeing work if given the chance could make
you seem lazy. On the other hand, if you answer, “Oh, I’d want to keep doing exactly
what I am doing, only doing it for your firm,” you could easily inspire your interviewer to
silently mutter to himself, “Yeah, sure. Gimme a break.”
BEST ANSWER: This type of question is aimed at getting at your bedrock attitude
about work and how you feel about what you do. Your best answer will focus on your
positive feelings.






Example: “After I floated down from cloud nine, I think I would still hold my basic belief
that achievement and purposeful work are essential to a happy, productive life. After all,
if money alone bought happiness, then all rich people would be all happy, and that’s not
true.
“I love the work I do, and I think I’d always want to be involved in my career in some
fashion. Winning the lottery would make it more fun because it would mean having more
flexibility, more options...who knows?”
“Of course, since I can’t count on winning, I’d just as soon create my own destiny by
sticking with what’s worked for me, meaning good old reliable hard work and a desire to
achieve. I think those qualities have built many more fortunes that all the lotteries put
together.”
Question 61 Looking back on your last position, have you done your


best work?


TRAPS: Tricky question. Answer “absolutely” and it can seem like your best work is
behind you. Answer, “no, my best work is ahead of me,” and it can seem as if you didn’t
give it your all.
BEST ANSWER: To cover both possible paths this question can take, your answer
should state that you always try to do your best, and the best of your career is right now.
Like an athlete at the top of his game, you are just hitting your career stride thanks to
several factors. Then, recap those factors, highlighting your strongest qualifications.
Question 62 Why should I hire you from the outside when I could


promote someone from within?


TRAPS: This question isn’t as aggressive as it sounds. It represents the interviewer’s
own dilemma over this common problem. He’s probably leaning toward you already and
for reassurance, wants to hear what you have to say on the matter.
BEST ANSWER: Help him see the qualifications that only you can offer.
Example: “In general, I think it’s a good policy to hire from within – to look outside
probably means you’re not completely comfortable choosing someone from inside.
“Naturally, you want this department to be as strong as it possibly can be, so you want
the strongest candidate. I feel that I can fill that bill because...(then recap your strongest
qualifications that match up with his greatest needs).”






Question 63 Tell me something negative you’ve heard about our


company...


TRAPS: This is a common fishing expedition to see what the industry grapevine may be
saying about the company. But it’s also a trap because as an outsider, you never want
to be the bearer of unflattering news or gossip about the firm. It can only hurt your
chances and sidetrack the interviewer from getting sold on you.
BEST ANSWER: Just remember the rule – never be negative – and you’ll handle this
one just fine.
Question 64 On a scale of one to ten, rate me as an interviewer.
TRAPS: Give a perfect “10,” and you’ll seem too easy to please. Give anything less
than a perfect 10, and he could press you as to where you’re being critical, and that road
leads downhill for you.
BEST ANSWER: Once again, never be negative. The interviewer will only resent
criticism coming from you. This is the time to show your positivism.
However, don’t give a numerical rating. Simply praise whatever interview style he’s been
using.
If he’s been tough, say “You have been thorough and tough-minded, the very qualities
needed to conduct a good interview.”
If he’s been methodical, say, “You have been very methodical and analytical, and I’m
sure that approach results in excellent hires for your firm.”
In other words, pay him a sincere compliment that he can believe because it’s anchored
in the behavior you’ve just seen.",-0.13107029,0.21662876,0.38470107,-0.21548359,-0.089755364,0.17852262,-0.21039562,0.14233476,-0.07962643,0.010766346,0.08063927,0.009220926,0.2460044,0.0024064465,0.09378055,-0.26576728,0.15225618,0.14939363,-0.3814652,0.2659644,0.17149283,-0.057487745,0.13698606,-0.06522578,0.16121706,-0.07347083,-0.12998037,-0.49334285,0.09661569,-0.18839435,-0.06319152,0.5174643,-0.037163995,0.021092758,0.015528772,0.29845014,-0.032712277,0.20520131,-0.0049922764,-0.16679807,-0.37317517,-0.20250691,0.12810649,-0.37686116,-0.17601536,0.01143927,0.21401997,-0.31906804,-0.11909384,-0.80684304,0.066095226,-0.06583252,0.12535325,1.0593768,-0.19304913,-2.2986245,0.079490125,-0.23457186,1.5635802,0.43508548,-0.13560581,0.77821404,-0.26055035,0.07983005,0.77423483,0.00649548,0.48574936,0.3012736,0.12681818,-0.22492766,-0.0035948905,-0.26422706,-0.08668617,-0.3815157,0.18674499,0.06193783,-0.16085757,-0.08366611,-0.7733196,-0.011320929,0.5516094,0.056452405,-0.49333736,0.08421244,-1.3941008,-0.2045614,0.101442516,-0.059980884,-0.18052576,-0.37293977,-0.107509464,-0.05860052,-0.07395804,-0.0030588342,-0.46470174,-0.054691788,-0.20943752,-0.32329547,0.51441723,0.2795085
Interview_Answers,Top 100 Python Interview Questions You Must Prepare In 2019,"﻿Q2. What are the key features of Python?
Python is an interpreted language. That means that, unlike languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be
compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby.
Python is dynamically typed, this means that you don’t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or
anything like that. You can do things like x=111 and then x=""I'm a string"" without error
Python is well suited to object orientated programming in that it allows the de


nition of classes along with composition


and inheritance. Python does not have access speci


ers (like C++’s public, private).


In Python, functions are


rst-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other


functions and passed into functions. Classes are also


rst class objects


Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately,Python allows the
inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are. The numpy package is a good
example of this, it’s really quite quick because a lot of the number crunching it does isn’t actually done by Python
Python
nds use in many spheres – web applications, automation, scienti


c modeling, big data applications and many


more. It’s also often used as “glue” code to get other languages and components to play nice.
Q3. What type of language is python? Programming or scripting?
Ans: Python is capable of scripting, but in general sense, it is considered as a general-purpose programming language. To know
more about Scripting, you can refer to the Python Scripting Tutorial.
Q4.How is Python an interpreted language?
Ans: An interpreted language is any programming language which is not in machine level code before runtime. Therefore,
Python is an interpreted language.
Q5.What is pep 8?
Ans: PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It is a set of rules that specify how to format Python code for maximum
readability.
Q6. How is memory managed in Python?
Ans:
1. Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are
located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of
this instead.
2. The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some
tools for the programmer to code.
3. Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to
the heap space.
Q7. What is namespace in Python?
Ans: A namespace is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming con
icts.


Q8. What is PYTHONPATH?


Python Inter ython Interview Questions And Answers | P view Questions And Answers | Python Inter ython Interview Pr view Preparati...




Ans: It is an environment variable which is used when a module is imported. Whenever a module is imported, PYTHONPATH is
also looked up to check for the presence of the imported modules in various directories. The interpreter uses it to determine
which module to load.
Q9. What are python modules? Name some commonly used built-in modules in Python?
Ans: Python modules are


les containing Python code. This code can either be functions classes or variables. A Python module is


a .py
le containing executable code.
Some of the commonly used built-in modules are:
os
sys
math
random
data time
JSON
Q10.What are local variables and global variables in Python?
Global Variables:
Variables declared outside a function or in global space are called global variables. These variables can be accessed by any
function in the program.
Local Variables:
Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable. This variable is present in the local space and not in the
global space.
Example:


a=2
def add():
b=3
c=a+b
print(c)
add()


Output: 5
When you try to access the local variable outside the function add(), it will throw an error.
Q11. Is python case sensitive?
Ans: Yes. Python is a case sensitive language.
Q12.What is type conversion in Python?
Ans: Type conversion refers to the conversion of one data type iinto another.
int() – converts any data type into integer type
oat() – converts any data type into


oat type
ord() – converts characters into integer
hex() – converts integers to hexadecimal
oct() – converts integer to octal
tuple() – This function is used to convert to a tuple.
set() – This function returns the type after converting to set.
list() – This function is used to convert any data type to a list type.
dict() – This function is used to convert a tuple of order (key,value) into a dictionary.
str() – Used to convert integer into a string.




complex(real,imag) – This functionconverts real numbers to complex(real,imag) number.
Q13. How to install Python on Windows and set path variable?
Ans: To install Python on Windows, follow the below steps:
Install python from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
After this, install it on your PC. Look for the location where PYTHON has been installed on your PC using the following
command on your command prompt: cmd python.
Then go to advanced system settings and add a new variable and name it as PYTHON_NAME and paste the copied path.
Look for the path variable, select its value and select ‘edit’.
Add a semicolon towards the end of the value if it’s not present and then type %PYTHON_HOME%
Q14. Is indentation required in python?
Ans: Indentation is necessary for Python. It speci


es a block of code. All code within loops, classes, functions, etc is speci
ed
within an indented block. It is usually done using four space characters. If your code is not indented necessarily, it will not
execute accurately and will throw errors as well.
Q15. What is the di


erence between Python Arrays and lists?


Ans: Arrays and lists, in Python, have the same way of storing data. But, arrays can hold only a single data type elements whereas
lists can hold any data type elements.
Example:
import array as arr
My_Array=arr.array('i',[1,2,3,4])
My_list=[1,'abc',1.20]
print(My_Array)
print(My_list)
Output:
array(‘i’, [1, 2, 3, 4]) [1, ‘abc’, 1.2]
Q16. What are functions in Python?
Ans: A function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called. To de


ne a Python function, the def keyword is used.


Example:
def Newfunc():
print(""Hi, Welcome to Edureka"")
Newfunc(); #calling the function
Output: Hi, Welcome to Edureka
Q17.What is __init__?
Ans: __init__ is a method or constructor in Python. This method is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/
instance of a class is created. All classes have the __init__ method.
Here is an example of how to use it.
class Employee:
def __init__(self, name, age,salary):
self.name = name
self.age = age
self.salary = 20000
E1 = Employee(""XYZ"", 23, 20000)
# E1 is the instance of class Employee.
#__init__ allocates memory for E1.
print(E1.name)
print(E1.age)
print(E1.salary)
Output:


XYZ




23
20000
Q18.What is a lambda function?
Ans: An anonymous function is known as a lambda function. This function can have any number of parameters but, can have
just one statement.
Example:
a = lambda x,y : x+y
print(a(5, 6))
Output: 11
Q19. What is self in Python?
Ans: Self is an instance or an object of a class. In Python, this is explicitly included as the


rst parameter. However, this is not the


case in Java where it’s optional. It helps to di


erentiate between the methods and attributes of a class with local variables.
The self variable in the init method refers to the newly created object while in other methods, it refers to the object whose
method was called.
Q20. How does break, continue and pass work?
Break Allows loop termination when some condition is met and the control is transferred


to the next statement.


Continue


Allows skipping some part of a loop when some speci


c condition is met and the


control is transferred to the beginning of the loop


Pass


Used when you need some block of code syntactically, but you want to skip its
execution. This is basically a null operation. Nothing happens when this is executed.


Q21. What does [::-1} do?
Ans: [::-1] is used to reverse the order of an array or a sequence.
For example:
import array as arr
My_Array=arr.array('i',[1,2,3,4,5])
My_Array[::-1]
Output: array(‘i’, [5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
[::-1] reprints a reversed copy of ordered data structures such as an array or a list. the original array or list remains unchanged.


Q22. How can you randomize the items of a list in place in Python?
Ans: Consider the example shown below:
from random import shuffle
x = ['Keep', 'The', 'Blue', 'Flag', 'Flying', 'High']
shuffle(x)
print(x)
The output of the following code is as below.
['Flying', 'Keep', 'Blue', 'High', 'The', 'Flag']
Q23. What are python iterators?
Ans: Iterators are objects which can be traversed though or iterated upon.
Q24. How can you generate random numbers in Python?
Ans: Random module is the standard module that is used to generate a random number. The method is de
ned as:


import random
random.random


The statement random.random() method return the


oating point number that is in the range of [0, 1). The function generates


random


oat numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are the bound methods of the hidden instances. The


instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading programs that creates a di


erent instance of individual


threads. The other random generators that are used in this are:
1. randrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and de


ne the range in-between [a, b). It returns the elements by selecting it


randomly from the range that is speci


ed. It doesn’t build a range object.


2. uniform(a, b): it chooses a


oating point number that is de


ned in the range of [a,b).Iyt returns the


oating point number
3. normalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where the mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is
used for standard deviation.
4. The Random class that is used and instantiated creates an independent multiple random number generators.
Q25. What is the di


erence between range & xrange?


Ans: For the most part, xrange and range are the exact same in terms of functionality. They both provide a way to generate a list
of integers for you to use, however you please. The only di


erence is that range returns a Python list object and x range returns


an xrange object.
This means that xrange doesn’t actually generate a static list at run-time like range does. It creates the values as you need them
with a special technique called yielding. This technique is used with a type of object known as generators. That means that if you
have a really gigantic range you’d like to generate a list for, say one billion, xrange is the function to use.
This is especially true if you have a really memory sensitive system such as a cell phone that you are working with, as range will
use as much memory as it can to create your array of integers, which can result in a Memory Error and crash your program. It’s a
memory hungry beast.
Q26. How do you write comments in python?
Ans: Comments in Python start with a # character. However, alternatively at times, commenting is done using docstrings(strings
enclosed within triple quotes).
Example:
#Comments in Python start like this
print(""Comments in Python start with a #"")
Output: Comments in Python start with a #
Q27. What is pickling and unpickling?
Ans: Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a


le by using dump
function, this process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string
representation is called unpickling.
Q28. What are the generators in python?
Ans: Functions that return an iterable set of items are called generators.
Q29. How will you capitalize the


rst letter of string?
Ans: In Python, the capitalize() method capitalizes the


rst letter of a string. If the string already consists of a capital letter at the


beginning, then, it returns the original string.
Q30. How will you convert a string to all lowercase?
Ans: To convert a string to lowercase, lower() function can be used.
Example:
stg='ABCD'
print(stg.lower())
Output: abcd
Q31. How to comment multiple lines in python?
Ans: Multi-line comments appear in more than one line. All the lines to be commented are to be pre


xed by a #. You can also a
very good shortcut method to comment multiple lines. All you need to do is hold the ctrl key and left click in every place
wherever you want to include a # character and type a # just once. This will comment all the lines where you introduced your
cursor.
Q32.What are docstrings in Python?




Ans: Docstrings are not actually comments, but, they are documentation strings. These docstrings are within triple quotes.
They are not assigned to any variable and therefore, at times, serve the purpose of comments as well.
Example:
""""""
Using docstring as a comment.
This code divides 2 numbers
""""""
x=8
y=4
z=x/y
print(z)
Output: 2.0
Q33. What is the purpose of is, not and in operators?
Ans: Operators are special functions. They take one or more values and produce a corresponding result.
is: returns true when 2 operands are true (Example: “a” is ‘a’)
not: returns the inverse of the boolean value
in: checks if some element is present in some sequence
Q34. What is the usage of help() and dir() function in Python?
Ans: Help() and dir() both functions are accessible from the Python interpreter and used for viewing a consolidated dump of
built-in functions.
1. Help() function: The help() function is used to display the documentation string and also facilitates you to see the help
related to modules, keywords, attributes, etc.
2. Dir() function: The dir() function is used to display the de


ned symbols.
Q35. Whenever Python exits, why isn’t all the memory de-allocated?
Ans:
1. Whenever Python exits, especially those Python modules which are having circular references to other objects or the
objects that are referenced from the global namespaces are not always de-allocated or freed.
2. It is impossible to de-allocate those portions of memory that are reserved by the C library.
3. On exit, because of having its own e


cient clean up mechanism, Python would try to de-allocate/destroy every other


object.
Q36. What is a dictionary in Python?
Ans: The built-in datatypes in Python is called dictionary. It de


nes one-to-one relationship between keys and values. Dictionaries


contain pair of keys and their corresponding values. Dictionaries are indexed by keys.
Let’s take an example:
The following example contains some keys. Country, Capital & PM. Their corresponding values are India, Delhi and Modi
respectively.
dict={'Country':'India','Capital':'Delhi','PM':'Modi'}
print dict[Country]
India
print dict[Capital]
Delhi
print dict[PM]
Modi
Q37. How can the ternary operators be used in python?
Ans: The Ternary operator is the operator that is used to show the conditional statements. This consists of the true or false
values with a statement that has to be evaluated for it.




Syntax:
The Ternary operator will be given as:
[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]x, y = 25, 50big = x if x < y else y
Example:
The expression gets evaluated like if x<y else y, in this case if x<y is true then the value is returned as big=x and if it is incorrect
then big=y will be sent as a result.
Q38. What does this mean: *args, **kwargs? And why would we use it?
Ans: We use *args when we aren’t sure how many arguments are going to be passed to a function, or if we want to pass a stored
list or tuple of arguments to a function. **kwargs is used when we don’t know how many keyword arguments will be passed to a
function, or it can be used to pass the values of a dictionary as keyword arguments. The identi


ers args and kwargs are a


convention, you could also use *bob and **billy but that would not be wise.
Q39. What does len() do?
Ans: It is used to determine the length of a string, a list, an array, etc.
Example:
stg='ABCD'
len(stg)
Q40. Explain split(), sub(), subn() methods of “re” module in Python.
Ans: To modify the strings, Python’s “re” module is providing 3 methods. They are:
split() – uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list.
sub() –
nds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then replace them with a di


erent string


subn() – it is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along with the no. of replacements.
Q41. What are negative indexes and why are they used?
Ans: The sequences in Python are indexed and it consists of the positive as well as negative numbers. The numbers that are
positive uses ‘0’ that is uses as


rst index and ‘1’ as the second index and the process goes on like that.


The index for the negative number starts from ‘-1’ that represents the last index in the sequence and ‘-2’ as the penultimate index
and the sequence carries forward like the positive number.
The negative index is used to remove any new-line spaces from the string and allow the string to except the last character that is
given as S[:-1]. The negative index is also used to show the index to represent the string in correct order.
Q42. What are Python packages?
Ans: Python packages are namespaces containing multiple modules.
Q43.How can


les be deleted in Python?


Ans: To delete a


le in Python, you need to import the OS Module. After that, you need to use the os.remove() function.


Example:
import os
os.remove(""xyz.txt"")
Q44. What are the built-in types of python?
Ans: Built-in types in Python are as follows –
Integers
Floating-point
Complex numbers
Strings
Boolean
Built-in functions
Q45. What advantages do NumPy arrays o


er over (nested) Python lists?


Ans:
1. Python’s lists are e


cient general-purpose containers. They support (fairly) e


cient insertion, deletion, appending, and


concatenation, and Python’s list comprehensions make them easy to construct and manipulate.




2. They have certain limitations: they don’t support “vectorized” operations like elementwise addition and multiplication, and
the fact that they can contain objects of di


ering types mean that Python must store type information for every element,


and must execute type dispatching code when operating on each element.
3. NumPy is not just more e


cient; it is also more convenient. You get a lot of vector and matrix operations for free, which


sometimes allow one to avoid unnecessary work. And they are also e


ciently implemented.


4. NumPy array is faster and You get a lot built in with NumPy, FFTs, convolutions, fast searching, basic statistics, linear
algebra, histograms, etc.
Q46. How to add values to a python array?
Ans: Elements can be added to an array using the append(), extend() and the insert (i,x) functions.
Example:
a=arr.array('d', [1.1 , 2.1 ,3.1] )
a.append(3.4)
print(a)
a.extend([4.5,6.3,6.8])
print(a)
a.insert(2,3.8)
print(a)
Output:
array(‘d’, [1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.4])
array(‘d’, [1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.4, 4.5, 6.3, 6.8])
array(‘d’, [1.1, 2.1, 3.8, 3.1, 3.4, 4.5, 6.3, 6.8])
Q47. How to remove values to a python array?
Ans: Array elements can be removed using pop() or remove() method. The di


erence between these two functions is that the


former returns the deleted value whereas the latter does not.
Example:


a=arr.array('d', [1.1, 2.2, 3.8, 3.1, 3.7, 1.2, 4.6])
print(a.pop())
print(a.pop(3))
a.remove(1.1)
print(a)
Output:
4.6
3.1
array(‘d’, [2.2, 3.8, 3.7, 1.2])
Q48. Does Python have OOps concepts?
Ans: Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that any program can be solved in python by creating an
object model. However, Python can be treated as procedural as well as structural language.
Q49. What is the di


erence between deep and shallow copy?


Ans: Shallow copy is used when a new instance type gets created and it keeps the values that are copied in the new instance.
Shallow copy is used to copy the reference pointers just like it copies the values. These references point to the original objects
and the changes made in any member of the class will also a


ect the original copy of it. Shallow copy allows faster execution of


the program and it depends on the size of the data that is used.
Deep copy is used to store the values that are already copied. Deep copy doesn’t copy the reference pointers to the objects. It
makes the reference to an object and the new object that is pointed by some other object gets stored. The changes made in the
original copy won’t a


ect any other copy that uses the object. Deep copy makes execution of the program slower due to making


certain copies for each object that is been called.
Q50. How is Multithreading achieved in Python?




Ans:
1. Python has a multi-threading package but if you want to multi-thread to speed your code up, then it’s usually not a good
idea to use it.
2. Python has a construct called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL makes sure that only one of your ‘threads’ can
execute at any one time. A thread acquires the GIL, does a little work, then passes the GIL onto the next thread.
3. This happens very quickly so to the human eye it may seem like your threads are executing in parallel, but they are really
just taking turns using the same CPU core.
4. All this GIL passing adds overhead to execution. This means that if you want to make your code run faster then using the
threading package often isn’t a good idea.
Q51. What is the process of compilation and linking in python?
Ans: The compiling and linking allows the new extensions to be compiled properly without any error and the linking can be done
only when it passes the compiled procedure. If the dynamic loading is used then it depends on the style that is being provided
with the system. The python interpreter can be used to provide the dynamic loading of the con


guration setup


les and will


rebuild the interpreter.
The steps that are required in this as:
1. Create a


le with any name and in any language that is supported by the compiler of your system. For example
le.c or


le.cpp
2. Place this


le in the Modules/ directory of the distribution which is getting used.


3. Add a line in the


le Setup.local that is present in the Modules/ directory.


4. Run the

Q54. How to import modules in python?


Modules can be imported using the import keyword. You can import modules in three ways-
Example:


import array #importing using the original module name
import array as arr # importing using an alias name
from array import * #imports everything present in the array module


OOPS Interview Questions
Q55. Explain Inheritance in Python with an example.
Ans: Inheritance allows One class to gain all the members(say attributes and methods) of another class. Inheritance provides


code reusability, makes it easier to create and maintain an application. The class from which we are inheriting is called super-
class and the class that is inherited is called a derived / child class.


They are di


erent types of inheritance supported by Python:


1. Single Inheritance – where a derived class acquires the members of a single super class.
2. Multi-level inheritance – a derived class d1 in inherited from base class base1, and d2 are inherited from base2.
3. Hierarchical inheritance – from one base class you can inherit any number of child classes
4. Multiple inheritance – a derived class is inherited from more than one base class.
Q56. How are classes created in Python?




Ans: Class in Python is created using the class keyword.
Example:
class Employee:
def __init__(self, name):
self.name = name
E1=Employee(""abc"")
print(E1.name)
Output: abc
Q57. What is monkey patching in Python?
Ans: In Python, the term monkey patch only refers to dynamic modi


cations of a class or module at run-time.


Consider the below example:
# m.py
class MyClass:
def f(self):
print ""f()""
We can then run the monkey-patch testing like this:
import m
def monkey_f(self):
print ""monkey_f()""
m.MyClass.f = monkey_f
obj = m.MyClass()
obj.f()
The output will be as below:
monkey_f()
As we can see, we did make some changes in the behavior of f() in MyClass using the function we de


ned, monkey_f(), outside of


the module m.
Q58. Does python support multiple inheritance?
Ans: Multiple inheritance means that a class can be derived from more than one parent classes. Python does support multiple
inheritance, unlike Java.
Q59. What is Polymorphism in Python?
Ans: Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms. So, for instance, if the parent class has a method named ABC then
the child class also can have a method with the same name ABC having its own parameters and variables. Python allows
polymorphism.
Q60. De


ne encapsulation in Python?


Ans: Encapsulation means binding the code and the data together. A Python class in an example of encapsulation.
Q61. How do you do data abstraction in Python?
Ans: Data Abstraction is providing only the required details and hiding the implementation from the world. It can be achieved in
Python by using interfaces and abstract classes.
Q62.Does python make use of access speci
ers?


Ans: Python does not deprive access to an instance variable or function. Python lays down the concept of pre


xing the name of
the variable, function or method with a single or double underscore to imitate the behavior of protected and private access
speci
ers.
Q63. How to create an empty class in Python?
Ans: An empty class is a class that does not have any code de


ned within its block. It can be created using the pass keyword.
However, you can create objects of this class outside the class itself. IN PYTHON THE PASS command does nothing when its
executed. it’s a null statement.
For example-


class a:
&nbsp; pass
obj=a()
obj.name=""xyz""
print(""Name = "",obj.name)
Output:
Name = xyz
Q64. What does an object() do?
Ans: It returns a featureless object that is a base for all classes. Also, it does not take any parameters.

Python Libraries Interview Questions
Q73. Explain what Flask is and its bene
ts?


Ans: Flask is a web microframework for Python based on “Werkzeug, Jinja2 and good intentions” BSD license. Werkzeug and
Jinja2 are two of its dependencies. This means it will have little to no dependencies on external libraries. It makes the framework
light while there is a little dependency to update and fewer security bugs.
A session basically allows you to remember information from one request to another. In a


ask, a session uses a signed cookie
so the user can look at the session contents and modify. The user can modify the session if only it has the secret key
Flask.secret_key.
Q74. Is Django better than Flask?
Ans: Django and Flask map the URL’s or addresses typed in the web browsers to functions in Python.
Flask is much simpler compared to Django but, Flask does not do a lot for you meaning you will need to specify the details,
whereas Django does a lot for you wherein you would not need to do much work. Django consists of prewritten code, which the
user will need to analyze whereas Flask gives the users to create their own code, therefore, making it simpler to understand the
code. Technically both are equally good and both contain their own pros and cons.
Q75. Mention the di


erences between Django, Pyramid and Flask.


Ans:
Flask is a “microframework” primarily build for a small application with simpler requirements. In


ask, you have to use


external libraries. Flask is ready to use.
Pyramid is built for larger applications. It provides


exibility and lets the developer use the right tools for their project. The


developer can choose the database, URL structure, templating style and more. Pyramid is heavy con


gurable.


Django can also be used for larger applications just like Pyramid. It includes an ORM.
Q76. Discuss Django architecture.
Ans: Django MVT Pattern:




Figure: Python Interview Questions – Django Architecture


The developer provides the Model, the view and the template then just maps it to a URL and Django does the magic to serve it to
the user.
Q77. Explain how you can set up the Database in Django.
Ans: You can use the command edit mysite/setting.py, it is a normal python module with module level representing Django
settings.
Django uses SQLite by default; it is easy for Django users as such it won’t require any other type of installation. In the case your
database choice is di


erent that you have to the following keys in the DATABASE ‘default’ item to match your database


connection settings.
Engines: you can change the database by using ‘django.db.backends.sqlite3’ , ‘django.db.backeneds.mysql’,
‘django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2’, ‘django.db.backends.oracle’ and so on
Name: The name of your database. In the case if you are using SQLite as your database, in that case, database will be a
le


on your computer, Name should be a full absolute path, including the


le name of that
le.


If you are not choosing SQLite as your database then settings like Password, Host, User, etc. must be added.
Django uses SQLite as a default database, it stores data as a single


le in the


lesystem. If you do have a database server—
PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL—and want to use it rather than SQLite, then use your database’s administration tools to
create a new database for your Django project. Either way, with your (empty) database in place, all that remains is to tell Django
how to use it. This is where your project’s settings.py


le comes in.


We will add the following lines of code to the setting.py
le:


DATABASES = {
'default': {
'ENGINE' : 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
'NAME' : os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
}
}
Q78. Give an example how you can write a VIEW in Django?
Ans: This is how we can use write a view in Django:
from django.http import HttpResponse
import datetime
def Current_datetime(request):
now = datetime.datetime.now()
html = ""<html><body>It is now %s</body></html> % now
return HttpResponse(html)
Returns the current date and time, as an HTML document
Q79. Mention what the Django templates consist of.
Ans: The template is a simple text


le. It can create any text-based format like XML, CSV, HTML, etc. A template contains
variables that get replaced with values when the template is evaluated and tags (% tag %) that control the logic of the template.


Figure: Python Interview Questions – Django Template




Q80. Explain the use of session in Django framework?
Ans: Django provides a session that lets you store and retrieve data on a per-site-visitor basis. Django abstracts the process of
sending and receiving cookies, by placing a session ID cookie on the client side, and storing all the related data on the server side.


Figure: Python Interview Questions – Django Framework


So the data itself is not stored client side. This is nice from a security perspective.
Q81. List out the inheritance styles in Django.
Ans: In Django, there are three possible inheritance styles:
1. Abstract Base Classes: This style is used when you only want parent’s class to hold information that you don’t want to type
out for each child model.
2. Multi-table Inheritance: This style is used If you are sub-classing an existing model and need each model to have its own
database table.
3. Proxy models: You can use this model, If you only want to modify the Python level behavior of the model, without changing
the model’s
elds.


Web Scraping – Python Interview Questions
Q82. How To Save An Image Locally Using Python Whose URL Address I Already Know?
Ans: We will use the following code to save an image locally from an URL address
import urllib.request
urllib.request.urlretrieve(""URL"", ""local-filename.jpg"")
Q83. How can you Get the Google cache age of any URL or web page?
Ans: Use the following URL format:
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:URLGOESHERE
Be sure to replace “URLGOESHERE” with the proper web address of the page or site whose cache you want to retrieve and see
the time for. For example, to check the Google Webcache age of edureka.co you’d use the following URL:
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:edureka.co
Q84. You are required to scrap data from IMDb top 250 movies page. It should only have


elds movie name, year, and


rating.
Ans: We will use the following lines of code:




from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import sys
url = 'http://www.imdb.com/chart/top'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text)
tr = soup.findChildren(""tr"")
tr = iter(tr)
next(tr)
for movie in tr:
title = movie.find('td', {'class': 'titleColumn'} ).find('a').contents[0]
year = movie.find('td', {'class': 'titleColumn'} ).find('span', {'class': 'secondaryInfo'}).contents[0]
rating = movie.find('td', {'class': 'ratingColumn imdbRating'} ).find('strong').contents[0]
row = title + ' - ' + year + ' ' + ' ' + rating
print(row)
The above code will help scrap data from IMDb’s top 250 list
Data Analysis – Python Interview Questions
Q85. What is map function in Python?
Ans: map function executes the function given as the first argument on all the elements of the iterable given as the second
argument. If the function given takes in more than 1 arguments, then many iterables are given. #Follow the link to know more
similar functions.
Q86. Is python numpy better than lists?
Ans: We use python numpy array instead of a list because of the below three reasons:
1. Less Memory
2. Fast
3. Convenient
For more information on these parameters, you can refer to this section – Numpy Vs List.
Q87. How to get indices of N maximum values in a NumPy array?
Ans: We can get the indices of N maximum values in a NumPy array using the below code:
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])
print(arr.argsort()[-3:][::-1])
Output
[ 4 3 1 ]
Q88. How do you calculate percentiles with Python/ NumPy?
Ans: We can calculate percentiles with the following code
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
p = np.percentile(a, 50) #Returns 50th percentile, e.g. median
print(p)
Output
3
Q89. What is the dierence between NumPy and SciPy?


Ans:
1. In an ideal world, NumPy would contain nothing but the array data type and the most basic operations: indexing, sorting,
reshaping, basic elementwise functions, et cetera.




2. All numerical code would reside in SciPy. However, one of NumPy’s important goals is compatibility, so NumPy tries to
retain all features supported by either of its predecessors.
3. Thus NumPy contains some linear algebra functions, even though these more properly belong in SciPy. In any case, SciPy
contains more fully-featured versions of the linear algebra modules, as well as many other numerical algorithms.
4. If you are doing scientic computing with python, you should probably install both NumPy and SciPy. Most new features


belong in SciPy rather than NumPy.
Q90. How do you make 3D plots/visualizations using NumPy/SciPy?
Ans: Like 2D plotting, 3D graphics is beyond the scope of NumPy and SciPy, but just as in the 2D case, packages exist that
integrate with NumPy. Matplotlib provides basic 3D plotting in the mplot3d subpackage, whereas Mayavi provides a wide range
of high-quality 3D visualization features, utilizing the powerful VTK engine.
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
Q91. Which of the following statements create a dictionary? (Multiple Correct Answers Possible)
a) d = {}
b) d = {“john”:40, “peter”:45}
c) d = {40:”john”, 45:”peter”}
d) d = (40:”john”, 45:”50”)
Answer: b, c & d.
Dictionaries are created by specifying keys and values.
Q92. Which one of these is


oor division?


a) /
b) //
c) %
d) None of the mentioned
Answer: b) //
When both of the operands are integer then python chops out the fraction part and gives you the round o


value, to get the


accurate answer use


oor division. For ex, 5/2 = 2.5 but both of the operands are integer so answer of this expression in python


is 2. To get the 2.5 as the answer, use


oor division using //. So, 5//2 = 2.5


Q93. What is the maximum possible length of an identi
er?


a) 31 characters
b) 63 characters
c) 79 characters
d) None of the above
Answer: d) None of the above

ers can be of any length.
Q94. Why are local variable names beginning with an underscore discouraged?
a) they are used to indicate a private variables of a class
b) they confuse the interpreter
c) they are used to indicate global variables
d) they slow down execution
Answer: a) they are used to indicate a private variable of a class
As Python has no concept of private variables, leading underscores are used to indicate variables that must not be accessed from
outside the class.
Q95. Which of the following is an invalid statement?
a) abc = 1,000,000
b) a b c = 1000 2000 3000

Spaces are not allowed in variable names.
Q96. What is the output of the following?




try:
if '1' != 1:
raise ""someError""
else:
print(""someError has not occured"")
except ""someError"":
print (""someError has occured"")
a) someError has occured
b) someError has not occured
c) invalid code
d) none of the above
Answer: c) invalid code
A new exception class must inherit from a BaseException. There is no such inheritance here.
Q97. Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, 25], What is list1[-1] ?
a) Error
b) None
c) 25
d) 2
Answer: c) 25
The index -1 corresponds to the last index in the list.
Q98. To open a


le c:scores.txt for writing, we use


a) out
le = open(“c:scores.txt”, “r”)
b) out
le = open(“c:scores.txt”, “w”)
c) out
le = open(


le = “c:scores.txt”, “r”)

businesses become more profitable. The following diagram illustrates the various steps
involved in the process:


• Collect Data: The data is collected from a variety of sources and is then stored to be
cleaned and prepared. This step involves removing all missing values and outliers.
• Analyse Data: As soon as the data is prepared, the next step is to analyze it. Improvements
are made by running a model repeatedly. Following that, the model is validated to ensure
that it is meeting the requirements.
• Create Reports: In the end, the model is implemented, and reports are generated as well as
distributed to stakeholders.
Q5 What are the different challenges one faces during data analysis?
While analyzing data, a Data Analyst can encounter the following issues:
• Duplicate entries and spelling errors. Data quality can be hampered and reduced by these
errors.
• The representation of data obtained from multiple sources may differ. It may cause a delay
in the analysis process if the collected data are combined after being cleaned and
organized.
• Another major challenge in data analysis is incomplete data. This would invariably lead to
errors or faulty results.
• You would have to spend a lot of time cleaning the data if you are extracting data from a
poor source.
• Business stakeholders' unrealistic timelines and expectations
• Data blending/ integration from multiple sources is a challenge, particularly if there are no
consistent parameters and conventions
• Insufficient data architecture and tools to achieve the analytics goals on time.
Q6 Explain data cleansing.
Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data scrubbing or wrangling, is basically a
process of identifying and then modifying, replacing, or deleting the incorrect, incomplete,
inaccurate, irrelevant, or missing portions of the data as the need arises. This fundamental
element of data science ensures data is correct, consistent, and usable.


Q7 What are the tools useful for data analysis?
Some of the tools useful for data analysis include:
1. R and Python
2. Microsoft Excel
3. Tableau
4. RapidMiner
5. KNIME
6. Power BI
7. Apache Spark
8. QlikView
9. Talend
10. Splunk


Q8 Write the difference between data mining and data profiling.
Data mining Process: It generally involves analyzing data to find relations that were not
previously discovered. In this case, the emphasis is on finding unusual records, detecting
dependencies, and analyzing clusters. It also involves analyzing large datasets to
determine trends and patterns in them.
Data Profiling Process: It generally involves analyzing that data's individual attributes. In
this case, the emphasis is on providing useful information on data attributes such as data
type, frequency, etc. Additionally, it also facilitates the discovery and evaluation of
enterprise metadata.
Data Mining Data Profiling
It involves analyzing a pre-built database to
identify patterns.


It involves analyses of raw data from
existing datasets.


It also analyzes existing databases and large
datasets to convert raw data into useful
information.


In this, statistical or informative
summaries of the data are collected.


It usually involves finding hidden patterns and
seeking out new, useful, and non-trivial data to
generate useful information.


It usually involves the evaluation of data
sets to ensure consistency, uniqueness,
and logic.


Data mining is incapable of identifying inaccurate
or incorrect data values.


In data profiling, erroneous data is
identified during the initial stage of
analysis.


Classification, regression, clustering,
summarization, estimation, and description are
some primary data mining tasks that are needed
to be performed.


This process involves using discoveries
and analytical methods to gather
statistics or summaries about the data.


Q9 Which validation methods are employed by data analysts?
In the process of data validation, it is important to determine the accuracy of the
information as well as the quality of the source. Datasets can be validated in many ways.
Methods of data validation commonly used by Data Analysts include:
• Field Level Validation: This method validates data as and when it is entered into the field.
The errors can be corrected as you go.
• Form Level Validation: This type of validation is performed after the user submits the
form. A data entry form is checked at once, every field is validated, and highlights the
errors (if present) so that the user can fix them.


• Data Saving Validation: This technique validates data when a file or database record is
saved. The process is commonly employed when several data entry forms must be
validated.
• Search Criteria Validation: It effectively validates the user's search criteria in order to
provide the user with accurate and related results. Its main purpose is to ensure that the
search results returned by a user's query are highly relevant.
Q10 Explain Outlier.
In a dataset, Outliers are values that differ significantly from the mean of characteristic
features of a dataset. With the help of an outlier, we can determine either variability in the
measurement or an experimental error. There are two kinds of outliers i.e., Univariate and
Multivariate. The graph depicted below shows there are four outliers in the dataset.


Q11 What are the ways to detect outliers? Explain different ways to deal with it.
Outliers are detected using two methods:
• Box Plot Method: According to this method, the value is considered an outlier if it exceeds
or falls below 1.5*IQR (interquartile range), that is, if it lies above the top quartile (Q3) or
below the bottom quartile (Q1).
• Standard Deviation Method: According to this method, an outlier is defined as a value
that is greater or lower than the mean ± (3*standard deviation).
Q12 Write difference between data analysis and data mining.
Data Analysis: It generally involves extracting, cleansing, transforming, modeling, and
visualizing data in order to obtain useful and important information that may contribute
towards determining conclusions and deciding what to do next. Analyzing data has been in
use since the 1960s.
Data Mining: In data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in the database, huge
quantities of knowledge are explored and analyzed to find patterns and rules. Since the
1990s, it has been a buzzword.


Data Analysis Data Mining
Analyzing data provides insight or tests hypotheses. A hidden pattern is identified and
discovered in large datasets.


It consists of collecting, preparing, and modeling data
in order to extract meaning or insights.


This is considered as one of the
activities in Data Analysis.
Data-driven decisions can be taken using this way. Data usability is the main objective.


Data Analysis Data Mining
Data visualization is certainly required. Visualization is generally not


necessary.


It is an interdisciplinary field that requires knowledge
of computer science, statistics, mathematics, and
machine learning.


Databases, machine learning, and
statistics are usually combined in
this field.
Here the dataset can be large, medium, or small, and
it can be structured, semi-structured, and
unstructured.


In this case, datasets are typically
large and structured.


Q13 Explain the KNN imputation method.
A KNN (K-nearest neighbor) model is usually considered one of the most common
techniques for imputation. It allows a point in multidimensional space to be matched with
its closest k neighbors. By using the distance function, two attribute values are compared.
Using this approach, the closest attribute values to the missing values are used to impute
these missing values.
Q14 Explain Normal Distribution.
Known as the bell curve or the Gauss distribution, the Normal Distribution plays a key role
in statistics and is the basis of Machine Learning. It generally defines and measures how
the values of a variable differ in their means and standard deviations, that is, how their
values are distributed.


The above image illustrates how data usually tend to be distributed around a central value
with no bias on either side. In addition, the random variables are distributed according to
symmetrical bell-shaped curves.
Q15 What do you mean by data visualization?
The term data visualization refers to a graphical representation of information and data.
Data visualization tools enable users to easily see and understand trends, outliers, and
patterns in data through the use of visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps. Data
can be viewed and analyzed in a smarter way, and it can be converted into diagrams and
charts with the use of this technology.
Q16 How does data visualization help you?
Data visualization has grown rapidly in popularity due to its ease of viewing and
understanding complex data in the form of charts and graphs. In addition to providing data
in a format that is easier to understand, it highlights trends and outliers. The best
visualizations illuminate meaningful information while removing noise from data.


Q17 Mention some of the python libraries used in data analysis.
Several Python libraries that can be used on data analysis include:
• NumPy
• Bokeh
• Matplotlib
• Pandas
• SciPy
• SciKit, etc.
Q18 Write characteristics of a good data model.
An effective data model must possess the following characteristics in order to be
considered good and developed:
• Provides predictability performance, so the outcomes can be estimated as precisely as
possible or almost as accurately as possible.
• As business demands change, it should be adaptable and responsive to accommodate
those changes as needed.
• The model should scale proportionally to the change in data.
• Clients/customers should be able to reap tangible and profitable benefits from it.
Q19 Write disadvantages of Data analysis.
The following are some disadvantages of data analysis:
• Data Analytics may put customer privacy at risk and result in compromising transactions,
purchases, and subscriptions.
• Tools can be complex and require previous training.
• Choosing the right analytics tool every time requires a lot of skills and expertise.
• It is possible to misuse the information obtained with data analytics by targeting people
with certain political beliefs or ethnicities.
Q20 What do you mean by Time Series Analysis? Where is it used?
In the field of Time Series Analysis (TSA), a sequence of data points is analyzed over an
interval of time. Instead of just recording the data points intermittently or randomly,
analysts record data points at regular intervals over a period of time in the TSA. It can be
done in two different ways: in the frequency and time domains. As TSA has a broad scope
of application, it can be used in a variety of fields. TSA plays a vital role in the following
places:
• Statistics
• Signal processing
• Econometrics
• Weather forecasting
• Earthquake prediction
• Astronomy
• Applied science
Q21 What do you mean by clustering algorithms? Write different properties of
clustering algorithms?
Clustering is the process of categorizing data into groups and clusters. In a dataset, it
identifies similar data groups. It is the technique of grouping a set of objects so that the
objects within the same cluster are similar to one another rather than to those located in
other clusters. When implemented, the clustering algorithm possesses the following
properties:
• Flat or hierarchical
• Hard or Soft
• Iterative
• Disjunctive


Q22 Name some popular tools used in big data.
In order to handle Big Data, multiple tools are used. There are a few popular ones as
follows:
• Hadoop
• Spark
• Scala
• Hive
• Flume
• Mahout, etc.
Q23 Explain Hierarchical clustering.
This algorithm group objects into clusters based on similarities, and it is also called
hierarchical cluster analysis. When hierarchical clustering is performed, we obtain a set of
clusters that differ from each other.


This clustering technique can be divided into two types:
• Agglomerative Clustering (which uses bottom-up strategy to decompose clusters)
• Divisive Clustering (which uses a top-down strategy to decompose clusters)
Q24 What do you mean by logistic regression?
Logistic Regression is basically a mathematical model that can be used to study datasets
with one or more independent variables that determine a particular outcome. By studying
the relationship between multiple independent variables, the model predicts a dependent
data variable.
Q25 What do you mean by the K-means algorithm?
One of the most famous partitioning methods is K-mean. With this unsupervised learning
algorithm, the unlabeled data is grouped in clusters. Here, 'k' indicates the number of
clusters. It tries to keep each cluster separated from the other. Since it is an unsupervised
model, there will be no labels for the clusters to work with.


Q26 Write the difference between variance and covariance.
Variance: In statistics, variance is defined as the deviation of a data set from its mean
value or average value. When the variances are greater, the numbers in the data set are
farther from the mean. When the variances are smaller, the numbers are nearer the mean.
Variance is calculated as follows:


Here, X represents an individual data point, U represents the average of multiple data
points, and N represents the total number of data points.
Covariance: Covariance is another common concept in statistics, like variance. In
statistics, covariance is a measure of how two random variables change when compared
with each other. Covariance is calculated as follows:


Here, X represents the independent variable, Y represents the dependent variable, x-bar
represents the mean of the X, y-bar represents the mean of the Y, and N represents the
total number of data points in the sample
.
Q27 Name the statistical methods that are highly beneficial for data analysts?
Accurate predictions and valuable results can only be achieved through the right statistical
methods for analysis. Research well to find the leading ones used by the majority of analysts
for varied tasks to deliver a reliable answer in the analyst interview questions.
• Bayesian method
• Markov process
• Simplex algorithm
• Imputation
• Spatial and cluster processes
• Rank statistics, percentile, outliers detection
• Mathematical optimization
In addition to this, there are various types of data analysis as well, which the data analysts


use-
1. Descriptive


2. Inferential
3. Differences
4. Associative
5. Predictive
Q28 What's the difference between a data lake and a data warehouse?
• Imputation techniques
• Bayesian methodologies
The storage of data is a big deal. Companies that use big data have been in the news a lot
lately, as they try to maximize its potential. Data storage is usually handled by traditional
databases for the layperson. For storing, managing, and analyzing big data, companies
use data warehouses and data lakes.


Data Warehouse: This is considered an ideal place to store all the data you gather from
many sources. A data warehouse is a centralized repository of data where data from
operational systems and other sources are stored. It is a standard tool for integrating data
across the team- or department-silos in mid-and large-sized companies. It collects and
manages data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. Data
warehouses can be of the following types:
• Enterprise data warehouse (EDW): Provides decision support for the entire organization.
• Operational Data Store (ODS): Has functionality such as reporting sales data or
employee data.
Data Lake: Data lakes are basically large storage device that stores raw data in their
original format until they are needed. with its large amount of data, analytical performance
and native integration are improved. It exploits data warehouses' biggest weakness: their
incapacity to be flexible. In this, neither planning nor knowledge of data analysis is
required; the analysis is assumed to happen later, on-demand.
Q29 What should a data analyst do with missing or suspected data?
In such a case, a data analyst needs to:


• Use data analysis strategies like deletion method, single imputation methods, and model-
based methods to detect missing data.


• Prepare a validation report containing all information about the suspected or missing data.
• Scrutinize the suspicious data to assess their validity.
• Replace all the invalid data (if any) with a proper validation code.
• Model preparation for the missing data
• Predict the missing values
Q30 Name the different data validation methods used by data analysts.
There are many ways to validate datasets. Some of the most commonly used data validation
methods by Data Analysts include:
• Field Level Validation – In this method, data validation is done in each field as and when a
user enters the data. It helps to correct the errors as you go.
• Form Level Validation – In this method, the data is validated after the user completes the
form and submits it. It checks the entire data entry form at once, validates all the fields in it,
and highlights the errors (if any) so that the user can correct it.
• Data Saving Validation – This data validation technique is used during the process of
saving an actual file or database record. Usually, it is done when multiple data entry forms
must be validated.
• Search Criteria Validation – This validation technique is used to offer the user accurate
and related matches for their searched keywords or phrases. The main purpose of this
validation method is to ensure that the user’s search queries can return the most relevant
results.
Q31 Define “Collaborative Filtering”.
Collaborative filtering is an algorithm that creates a recommendation system based on the
behavioral data of a user. For instance, online shopping sites usually compile a list of items
under “recommended for you” based on your browsing history and previous purchases. The
crucial components of this algorithm include users, objects, and their interests. It is used to
broaden the options the users could have. Online entertainment applications are another
example of collaborative filtering. For example, Netflix shows recommendations basis the


user’s behavior. It follows various techniques, such as-
1. Memory-based approach


2. Model-based approach


Q32 Mention the steps of a Data Analysis project.
The core steps of a Data Analysis project include:
• The foremost requirement of a Data Analysis project is an in-depth understanding of the
business requirements.
• The second step is to identify the most relevant data sources that best fit the business
requirements and obtain the data from reliable and verified sources.
• The third step involves exploring the datasets, cleaning the data, and organizing the same to
gain a better understanding of the data at hand.
• In the fourth step, Data Analysts must validate the data.
• The fifth step involves implementing and tracking the datasets.
• The final step is to create a list of the most probable outcomes and iterate until the desired
results are accomplished.
The whole meaning of the data analysis is to help in effective decision-making. The data
analysis projects are the steps towards achieving it. For example, while undergoing the
above-said process, the analysts use the past data and once the data has been analysed it
gets put in a presentable form so the decision-making process can be smoother.
Q33 What are the problems that a Data Analyst can encounter while performing data
analysis?
A critical data analyst interview question you need to be aware of. A Data Analyst can
confront the following issues while performing data analysis:
• Presence of duplicate entries and spelling mistakes. These errors can hamper data quality.
• Poor quality data acquired from unreliable sources. In such a case, a Data Analyst will have
to spend a significant amount of time in cleansing the data.
• Data extracted from multiple sources may vary in representation. Once the collected data is
combined after being cleansed and organized, the variations in data representation may
cause a delay in the analysis process.
• Incomplete data is another major challenge in the data analysis process. It would inevitably
lead to erroneous or faulty results.
Q34 Explain descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.
Descriptive Predictive Prescriptive


It provides insights into the
past to answer “what has
happened”


Understands the future to
answer “what could happen”


Suggest various courses
of action to answer “what
should you do”


Uses data aggregation
and data mining
techniques


Uses statistical models and
forecasting techniques


Uses simulation
algorithms and
optimization techniques
to advise possible
outcomes


Example: An ice cream
company can analyze how
much ice cream was sold,
which flavors were sold,
and whether more or less
ice cream was sold than
the day before


Example: An ice cream
company can analyze how
much ice cream was sold,
which flavors were sold, and
whether more or less ice
cream was sold than the day
before


Example: Lower prices to
increase the sale of ice
creams, produce
more/fewer quantities of
a specific flavor of ice
cream


Q35 Describe univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
The univariate analysis is the simplest and easiest form of data analysis where the data
being analyzed contains only one variable.
Example - Studying the heights of players in the NBA.
Univariate analysis can be described using Central Tendency, Dispersion, Quartiles, Bar
charts, Histograms, Pie charts, and Frequency distribution tables.
The bivariate analysis involves the analysis of two variables to find causes, relationships,
and correlations between the variables.
Example – Analyzing the sale of ice creams based on the temperature outside.
The bivariate analysis can be explained using Correlation coefficients, Linear regression,
Logistic regression, Scatter plots, and Box plots.
The multivariate analysis involves the analysis of three or more variables to understand the
relationship of each variable with the other variables.
Example – Analysing Revenue based on expenditure.
Multivariate analysis can be performed using Multiple regression, Factor analysis,
Classification & regression trees, Cluster analysis, Principal component analysis, Dual-axis
charts, etc.
Q36 What are the different types of Hypothesis testing?
Hypothesis testing is the procedure used by statisticians and scientists to accept or reject
statistical hypotheses. There are mainly two types of hypothesis testing:
• Null hypothesis: It states that there is no relation between the predictor and outcome
variables in the population. H0 denoted it.
Example: There is no association between a patient’s BMI and diabetes.
• Alternative hypothesis: It states that there is some relation between the predictor and
outcome variables in the population. It is denoted by H1.
Example: There could be an association between a patient’s BMI and diabetes.
Explain the Type I and Type II errors in Statistics?
In Hypothesis testing, a Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected even if it is
true. It is also known as a false positive.
A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected, even if it is false. It is also
known as a false negative.

Q6 Using the below sales table, calculate the total quantity sold by sales
representatives whose name starts with A, and the cost of each item they have sold is
greater than 10.


You can use the SUMIFS() function to find the total quantity.
For the Sales Rep column, you need to give the criteria as “A*” - meaning the name should
start with the letter “A”. For the Cost each column, the criteria should be “>10” - meaning the
cost of each item is greater than 10.


Q7 Using the data given below, create a pivot table to find the total sales made by
each sales representative for each item. Display the sales as % of the grand total.


• Select the entire table range, click on the Insert tab and choose PivotTable

sum of sales made by each representative for every item they have sold.


• Right-click on “Sum of Sale Total’ and expand Show Values As to select % of Grand
Total.


• Below is the resultant pivot table.


Q8 What do you mean by clustering algorithms? Write different properties of
clustering algorithms?
Clustering is the process of categorizing data into groups and clusters. In a dataset, it
identifies similar data groups. It is the technique of grouping a set of objects so that the
objects within the same cluster are similar to one another rather than to those located in
other clusters. When implemented, the clustering algorithm possesses the following
properties:
• Flat or hierarchical
• Hard or Soft
• Iterative
• Disjunctive
Q9 What is a Pivot table? Write its usage.
One of the basic tools for data analysis is the Pivot Table. With this feature, you can quickly
summarize large datasets in Microsoft Excel. Using it, we can turn columns into rows and
rows into columns. Furthermore, it permits grouping by any field (column) and applying
advanced calculations to them. It is an extremely easy-to-use program since you just drag
and drop rows/columns headers to build a report. Pivot tables consist of four different
sections:
• Value Area: This is where values are reported.
• Row Area: The row areas are the headings to the left of the values.


• Column Area: The headings above the values area make up the column area.
• Filter Area: Using this filter you may drill down in the data set.


Q10 Define Excel Charts.
A chart in Excel is a feature that allows you to display data through a range of visually
intuitive graphs. These charts and graphs can make it easier and quicker to comprehend
data compared to just looking at the numbers on the worksheet. Available charts on Excel
include:
• Bar graphs
• Line graphs
• Pie charts
• Area graph
• Scatter graphs
• Surface graphs
• Doughnut graphs
• Radar charts
VLOOKUP accepts the following four parameters:
• lookup_value - The value to look for in the first column of a table
• table - The table from where you can extract value
• col_index - The column from which to extract value
• range_lookup - [optional] TRUE = approximate match (default). FALSE = exact
match
• Let’s understand VLOOKUP with an example.


•
• If you wanted to find the department to which Stuart belongs to, you could use the
VLOOKUP function as shown below:


•
• Here, A11 cell has the lookup value, A2:E7 is the table array, 3 is the column index
number with information about departments, and 0 is the range lookup.
• If you hit enter, it will return “Marketing”, indicating that Stuart is from the marketing
department
•
Q11 What Is VLOOKUP?


VLOOKUP is a predetermined function in Excel that allows the user to find data within a
table corresponding to a particular row.
For instance, say you have a table of employee information that includes (from column A
onward) employee ID, employee name, start date, hours per week, and salary. With
VLOOKUP you can specify a row from the first column (i.e an employee number) and look
up corresponding data from other columns, like the salary of the employee with that
employee ID.
Q12 How Do You Use VLOOKUP?
The VLOOKUP syntax is composed of the lookup value, the range of data in which the
lookup value is located, and the column number within this range that contains the desired
return value. You can also specify whether you want an approximate match or an exact
match to be returned, but this step is optional.
In other words, you must first indicate the cell reference of the value you would like to search
for. Next, indicate the range of data you would like to search for (this will often be the entire
table). You can then specify the column that contains the information you seek and input it
as a number (the right-most column selected will be column 1).
To indicate whether the return value should be approximate or exact, finish the formula with
TRUE (for approximate) or FALSE (for exact). An example formula would look like this:
=VLOOKUP(A7,A1:E10,5,FALSE).


Q13 What Is the Default Value of the Last Parameter of VLOOKUP?
If the last parameter is not specified via TRUE or FALSE, the return value will default to
TRUE (approximate), and show an approximate match for your request.
Q14 What Is the Main Limitation of the VLOOKUP Function?
The VLOOKUP function can only move in one direction, from left to right. Therefore, the
information you wish to seek out must be located in a column to the right of the lookup
value’s location.
In newer versions of Excel, a successor to VLOOKUP has been added, called XLOOKUP.
This new function works in any direction and defaults to exact matches rather than
approximate. At some point in the future, XLOOKUP will completely replace VLOOKUP, but
this will not happen until the majority of users have moved away from using older versions of
Excel.
Q15 Does VLOOKUP Look Up Case-Sensitive Values?
VLOOKUP is not case-sensitive, and will always return the first value of the match
irrespective of the case. In other words, the name Apgar and the acronym APGAR would be
viewed as the same by VLOOKUP.
It is, however, possible to manipulate VLOOKUP into returning case-sensitive values by
using a helper column.
Q16 How Do the INDEX and MATCH Functions Work?
The MATCH function returns the position of a cell in a row or column based on its value and
the INDEX function will return the value of a cell based on the cell reference.
Q17 How Do the INDEX and MATCH Functions Work Together?
You can use two MATCH functions within an INDEX formula to specify a cell reference and
return the value of that cell. The dynamic formula will return the corresponding data of any
two MATCH values you input.
For example, if you have a table detailing the price per unit and the number of units sold for
a variety of products, you can use the match index function to return a specific piece of
information about a specific product.
Q18 What Is Conditional Formatting? How Can It Be Used?
Conditional formatting will apply various formatting types onto cells based on specified
conditions. For instance, it can be used to apply a highlight to any duplicate cells, or cells
with a numeric value under 5.

SQL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS


Q1 What is Data?
Data is a collection of a distinct small unit of information. It can be used in a variety of forms
like text, numbers, media, bytes, etc. it can be stored in pieces of paper or electronic memory,
etc.
Word 'Data' is originated from the word 'datum' that means 'single piece of information.' It is
plural of the word datum.
In computing, Data is information that can be translated into a form for efficient movement and
processing. Data is interchangeable.
Q2 What is Database?
A database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved digitally from a remote or
local computer system. Databases can be vast and complex, and such databases are
developed using fixed design and modeling approaches.
A database is a systematic collection of data. They support electronic storage and
manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy.
Let us discuss a database example: An online telephone directory uses a database to store
data of people, phone numbers, and other contact details. Your electricity service provider
uses a database to manage billing, client-related issues, handle fault data, etc.
Let us also consider Facebook. It needs to store, manipulate, and present data related to
members, their friends, member activities, messages, advertisements, and a lot more. We
can provide a countless number of examples for the usage of databases.
Q3 What is a Datawarehouse?
Datawarehouse refers to a central repository of data where the data is assembled from
multiple sources of information. Those data are consolidated, transformed and made available
for the mining as well as online processing. Warehouse data also have a subset of data called
Data Marts.
Q4 What is DBMS?
DBMS stands for Database Management System. DBMS is a system software responsible
for the creation, retrieval, updation, and management of the database. It ensures that our
data is consistent, organized, and is easily accessible by serving as an interface between
the database and its end-users or application software.
Q5 What is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The key difference here,
compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables, and
relations can be defined between the common fields of these tables. Most modern database
management systems like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Amazon
Redshift are based on RDBMS.


DBMS RDBMS
DBMS applications store data as file. RDBMS applications store data in a


tabular form.


In DBMS, data is generally stored in
either a hierarchical form or a navigational
form.


In RDBMS, the tables have an identifier
called primary key and the data values are
stored in the form of tables.
Normalization is not present in DBMS. Normalization is present in RDBMS.
DBMS does not apply any security with
regards to data manipulation.


RDBMS defines the integrity
constraint for the purpose of ACID
(Atomocity, Consistency, Isolation and
Durability) property.


DBMS uses file system to store data, so
there will be no relation between the
tables.


in RDBMS, data values are stored in the
form of tables, so a relationship between
these data values will be stored in the form
of a table as well.


DBMS has to provide some uniform
methods to access the stored
information.


RDBMS system supports a tabular
structure of the data and a relationship
between them to access the stored
information.


DBMS does not support distributed
database.


RDBMS supports distributed database.


DBMS is meant to be for small
organization and deal with small data. it
supports single user.


RDBMS is designed to handle large
amount of data. it supports multiple
users.
Examples of DBMS are file
systems, xml etc.


Example of RDBMS
are mysql, postgre, sql
server, oracle etc.


Q6 What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language for relational
database management systems. It is especially useful in handling organized data comprised
of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data.
Q7 What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
SQL is a standard language for retrieving and manipulating structured databases. On the
contrary, MySQL is a relational database management system, like SQL Server, Oracle or
IBM DB2, that is used to manage SQL databases.


SQL MySQL


SQL is a query programming language that
manages RDBMS.


MySQL is a relational database
management system that uses SQL.


SQL is primarily used to query and operate
database systems.


MySQL allows you to handle, store,
modify and delete data and store data in
an organized way.


SQL does not support any connector.


MySQL comes with an in-built tool
known as MySQL Workbench that
facilitates creating, designing, and
building databases.


SQL follows a simple standard format
without many or regular updates.


MySQL has numerous variants and gets
frequent updates.


SQL supports only a single storage engine.


MySQL offers support for multiple
storage engines along with plug-in
storage, making it more flexible.


SQL does not allow other processors or
even its own binaries to manipulate data
during execution.


MySQL is less secure than SQL, as it
allows third-party processors to
manipulate data files during execution.


Q8 What are the subsets of SQL?


The following are the four significant subsets of the SQL:
o Data definition language (DDL): It defines the data structure that consists of
commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc.
o Data manipulation language (DML): It is used to manipulate existing data in the
database. The commands in this category are SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, etc.
o Data control language (DCL): It controls access to the data stored in the database.
The commands in this category include GRANT and REVOKE.
o Transaction Control Language (TCL): It is used to deal with the transaction
operations in the database. The commands in this category are COMMIT, ROLLBACK,
SET TRANSACTION, SAVEPOINT, etc.
Q9 What is the purpose of DDL Language?
DDL stands for Data definition language. It is the subset of a database that defines the data
structure of the database when the database is created. For example, we can use the DDL
commands to add, remove, or modify tables. It consists of the following commands: CREATE,
ALTER and DELETE database objects such as schema, tables, indexes, view, sequence, etc.
Example
CREATE TABLE Students (
Roll_no INT,
Name VARCHAR(45),
Branch VARCHAR(30),
);


Q9 What is the purpose of DML Language?
Data manipulation language makes the user able to retrieve and manipulate data in a
relational database. The DML commands can only perform read-only operations on data. We
can perform the following operations using DDL language:
o Insert data into the database through the INSERT command.
o Retrieve data from the database through the SELECT command.
o Update data in the database through the UPDATE command.
o Delete data from the database through the DELETE command.
Example
INSERT INTO Student VALUES (111, 'George', 'Computer Science')
Q10 What is the purpose of DCL Language?
Data control language allows users to control access and permission management to the
database. It is the subset of a database, which decides that what part of the database should
be accessed by which user at what point of time. It includes two commands, GRANT and
REVOKE.
GRANT: It enables system administrators to assign privileges and roles to the specific user
accounts to perform specific tasks on the database.
REVOKE: It enables system administrators to revoke privileges and roles from the user
accounts so that they cannot use the previously assigned permission on the database.
Example
GRANT * ON mydb.Student TO javatpoint@localhsot;
Q11 What is a Query?
An SQL query is used to retrieve the required data from the database. However, there may
be multiple SQL queries that yield the same results but with different levels of efficiency.
An inefficient query can drain the database resources, reduce the database speed or result
in a loss of service for other users. So it is very important to optimize the query to obtain
the best database performance.
Q12 What is a SubQuery?
In SQL a Subquery can be simply defined as a query within another query. In other words,
we can say that a Subquery is a query that is embedded in the WHERE clause of another
SQL query.
Q13 What are Tables and Fields?
A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns. Columns
can be categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal. The columns in a table are called
fields while the rows can be referred to as records.
Q14 What are Constraints in SQL?
Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. It can be applied for
single or multiple fields in an SQL table during the creation of the table or after creating using
the ALTER TABLE command. The constraints are:
• NOT NULL - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
• CHECK - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
• DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
• UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field.
• INDEX - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
• PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
• FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.


Q15 What is a Primary Key?
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain
UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint.
A table in SQL is strictly restricted to have one and only one primary key, which is comprised
of single or multiple fields (columns).
CREATE TABLE tableName (
col1 int NOT NULL,
col2 varchar(50) NOT NULL,
col3 int,
................
PRIMARY KEY (col1)
);
Q16 What is a UNIQUE constraint?
A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. This provides
uniqueness for the column(s) and helps identify each row uniquely. Unlike primary key, there
can be multiple unique constraints defined per table. The code syntax for UNIQUE is quite
similar to that of PRIMARY KEY and can be used interchangeably.
CREATE TABLE Persons (
ID int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Age int
);
Q17 What is a Foreign Key?
A FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of fields in a table that essentially refers
to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity in
the relation between two tables.
The table with the foreign key constraint is labeled as the child table, and the table
containing the candidate key is labeled as the referenced or parent table.
CREATE TABLE childTable (
col1 int NOT NULL,
col2 int NOT NULL,
col3 int,
............
PRIMARY KEY (col1),
FOREIGN KEY (col3) REFERENCES parentTable(parent_Primary_key)
);


Q18 What is the difference between Primary key and Foreign key?
S.NO. PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY


1


A primary key is used to
ensure data in the specific
column is unique.


A foreign key is a column or group of
columns in a relational database table
that provides a link between data in
two tables.


2


It uniquely identifies a
record in the relational
database table.


It refers to the field in a table which is
the primary key of another table.


3


Only one primary key is
allowed in a table.


Whereas more than one foreign key
are allowed in a table.


4


It is a combination of
UNIQUE and Not Null
constraints.


It can contain duplicate values and a
table in a relational database.


5


It does not allow NULL
values. It can also contain NULL values.


6


Its value cannot be
deleted from the parent
table.


Its value can be deleted from the child
table.


7


It constraint can be
implicitly defined on the
temporary tables.


It constraint cannot be defined on the
local or global temporary tables.


Q19 What is a Join? List its different types.
The SQL Join clause is used to combine records (rows) from two or more tables in a SQL
database based on a related column between the two.


There are four different types of JOINs in SQL:
• (INNER) JOIN: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the
join. This is the widely used join for queries.
SELECT *
FROM Table_A
JOIN Table_B;
SELECT *
FROM Table_A
INNER JOIN Table_B;
• LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the left and the matched
records/rows from the right table.
SELECT *
FROM Table_A A
LEFT JOIN Table_B B
ON A.col = B.col;
• RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the right and the matched
records/rows from the left table.
SELECT *
FROM Table_A A
RIGHT JOIN Table_B B
ON A.col = B.col;
• FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records where there is a match in either the left or
right table.
SELECT *
FROM Table_A A
FULL JOIN Table_B B
ON A.col = B.col;
Q20 What is a Self-Join?
A self JOIN is a case of regular join where a table is joined to itself based on some relation
between its own column(s). Self-join uses the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN clause and a table
alias is used to assign different names to the table within the query.
SELECT A.emp_id AS ""Emp_ID"",A.emp_name AS ""Employee"",
B.emp_id AS ""Sup_ID"",B.emp_name AS ""Supervisor""
FROM employee A, employee B
WHERE A.emp_sup = B.emp_id;
Q21 What is a Cross-Join?
Cross join can be defined as a cartesian product of the two tables included in the join. The
table after join contains the same number of rows as in the cross-product of the number of
rows in the two tables. If a WHERE clause is used in cross join then the query will work like
an INNER JOIN.
SELECT stu.name, sub.subject
FROM students AS stu
CROSS JOIN subjects AS sub;


Q22 What is an Index? Explain its different types.
A database index is a data structure that provides a quick lookup of data in a column or
columns of a table. It enhances the speed of operations accessing data from a database
table at the cost of additional writes and memory to maintain the index data structure.
CREATE INDEX index_name /* Create Index */
ON table_name (column_1, column_2);
DROP INDEX index_name; /* Drop Index */
There are different types of indexes that can be created for different purposes:
• Unique and Non-Unique Index:
Unique indexes are indexes that help maintain data integrity by ensuring that no two rows of
data in a table have identical key values. Once a unique index has been defined for a table,
uniqueness is enforced whenever keys are added or changed within the index.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX myIndex
ON students (enroll_no);
Non-unique indexes, on the other hand, are not used to enforce constraints on the tables
with which they are associated. Instead, non-unique indexes are used solely to improve
query performance by maintaining a sorted order of data values that are used frequently.
• Clustered and Non-Clustered Index:
Clustered indexes are indexes whose order of the rows in the database corresponds to the
order of the rows in the index. This is why only one clustered index can exist in a given table,
whereas, multiple non-clustered indexes can exist in the table.
The only difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes is that the database
manager attempts to keep the data in the database in the same order as the corresponding
keys appear in the clustered index.
Clustering indexes can improve the performance of most query operations because they
provide a linear-access path to data stored in the database.
Q23 What are the different types of SQL operators?
Operators are the special keywords or special characters reserved for performing particular
operations. They are also used in SQL queries. We can primarily use these operators within
the WHERE clause of SQL commands. It's a part of the command to filters data based on the
specified condition. The SQL operators can be categorized into the following types:
o Arithmetic operators: These operators are used to perform mathematical operations
on numerical data. The categories of this operators are addition (+), subtraction (-),
multiplication (*), division (/), remainder/modulus (%), etc.


o Logical operators: These operators evaluate the expressions and return their results
in True or False. This operator includes ALL, AND, ANY, ISNULL, EXISTS,
BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, NOT, OR, UNIQUE.
o Comparison operators: These operators are used to perform comparisons of two
values and check whether they are the same or not. It includes equal to (=), not equal
to (!= or <>), less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), greater than or
equal to (>=), not less than (!<), not greater than (!>), etc.
o Bitwise operators: It is used to do bit manipulations between two expressions of
integer type. It first performs conversion of integers into binary bits and then applied
operators such as AND (& symbol), OR (|, ^), NOT (~), etc.
o Compound operators: These operators perform operations on a variable before
setting the variable's result to the operation's result. It includes Add equals (+=),
subtract equals (-=), multiply equals (*=), divide equals (/=), modulo equals (%=), etc.
o String operators: These operators are primarily used to perform concatenation and
pattern matching of strings. It includes + (String concatenation), += (String
concatenation assignment), % (Wildcard), [] (Character(s) matches), [^] (Character(s)
not to match), _ (Wildcard match one character), etc.
Q24 What is a view in SQL?
A view is a database object that has no values. It is a virtual table that contains a subset of
data within a table. It looks like an actual table containing rows and columns, but it takes less
space because it is not present physically. It is operated similarly to the base table but does
not contain any data of its own. Its name is always unique. A view can have data from one or
more tables. If any changes occur in the underlying table, the same changes reflected in the
views also.


The primary use of a view is to implement the security mechanism. It is the searchable object
where we can use a query to search the view as we use for the table. It only shows the data
returned by the query that was declared when the view was created.
We can create a view by using the following syntax:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_lists FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


Q25 What are the differences between SQL, MySQL, and SQL Server?
The following comparison chart explains their main differences:
SQL MySQL SQL Server
SQL or Structured Query
Language is useful for
managing our relational
databases. It is used to
query and operate the
database.


MySQL is the popular
database management
system used for managing
the relational database. It is


a fast, scalable, and easy-
to-use database.


SQL Server is an RDBMS
database system mainly
developed for the Windows
system to store, retrieve, and
access data requested by the
developer.


SQL first appeared in 1974. MySQL first appeared on


May 23, 1995.


SQL Server first appeared on April
24, 1989.


SQL was developed by IBM
Corporation.


MySQL was developed by
Oracle Corporation.


SQL Server was developed by
Microsoft Company.


SQL is a query language for
managing databases.


MySQL is database
software that uses SQL
language to conduct with
the database.


SQL Server is also a software that
uses SQL language to conduct
with the database.


SQL has no variables. MySQL can use variables
constraints and data types.


SQL Server can use variables
constraints and data types.


SQL is a programming
language, so that it does not
get any updates. Its
commands are always fixed
and remain the same.


MySQL is software, so it
gets frequent updation.


SQL Server is also software, so it
gets frequent updation.


Q26 What is the difference between SQL and PL/SQL?
The following comparison chart explains their main differences:
SQL PL/SQL
SQL is a database structured query
language used to communicate with
relational databases. It was developed by
IBM Corporations and first appeared in
1974.


PL/SQL or Procedural Language/Structured
Query Language is a dialect of SQL used to
enhance the capabilities of SQL. Oracle
Corporation developed it in the early 90's. It
uses SQL as its database language.


SQL is a declarative and data-oriented
language.


PL/SQL is a procedural and application-
oriented language.


SQL has no variables. PL/SQL can use variables constraints and data


types.


SQL can execute only a single query at a
time.


PL/SQL can execute a whole block of code at
once.


SQL query can be embedded in PL/SQL. PL/SQL cannot be embedded in SQL as SQL
does not support any programming language
and keywords.


SQL can directly interact with the
database server.


PL/SQL cannot directly interact with the
database server.


SQL is like the source of data that we
need to display.


PL/SQL provides a platform where SQL data
will be shown.
Q27 Is it possible to sort a column using a column alias?
Yes. We can use the alias method in the ORDER BY instead of the WHERE clause for sorting
a column.


Q28 What is the difference between IN and BETWEEN operators?
The following comparison chart explains their main differences:
BETWEEN Operator IN Operator
This operator is used to selects the range of
data between two values. The values can be
numbers, text, and dates as well.


It is a logical operator to determine whether
or not a specific value exists within a set of
values. This operator reduces the use of
multiple OR conditions with the query.


It returns records whose column value lies in
between the defined range.


It compares the specified column's value and
returns the records when the match exists in
the set of values.


The following syntax illustrates this operator:
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN 'value1'
AND 'value2';


The following syntax illustrates this operator:
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN ('value1','value
2');


Q29 What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE statements in SQL?
The main difference between them is that the delete statement deletes data without resetting
a table's identity, whereas the truncate command resets a particular table's identity. The
following comparison chart explains it more clearly:
DELETE TRUNCATE
The delete statement removes single or
multiple rows from an existing table
depending on the specified condition.


The truncate command deletes the whole
contents of an existing table without the table
itself. It preserves the table structure or
schema.


DELETE is a DML command. TRUNCATE is a DML command.


We can use the WHERE clause in the
DELETE command.


We cannot use the WHERE clause with
TRUNCATE.


DELETE statement is used to delete a
row from a table.


TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all
the rows from a table.


DELETE is slower because it maintained
the log.


TRUNCATE statement is faster than
DELETE statement as it deletes entire data at
a time without maintaining transaction logs.


You can roll back data after using the
DELETE statement.


It is not possible to roll back after using the
TRUNCATE statement.


DELETE query takes more space. TRUNCATE query occupies less space.
Q30 What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DROP statements?
DROP TRUNCATE
The DROP command is used to remove
table definition and its contents.


Whereas the TRUNCATE command is used
to delete all the rows from the table.


In the DROP command, table space is
freed from memory.


While the TRUNCATE command does not
free the table space from memory.


DROP is a DDL(Data Definition
Language) command.


Whereas the TRUNCATE is also a DDL(Data
Definition Language) command.


In the DROP command, a view of the
table does not exist.


While in this command, a view of the table
exists.


In the DROP command, integrity
constraints will be removed.


While in this command, integrity constraints
will not be removed.


In the DROP command, undo space is
not used.


While in this command, undo space is used
but less than DELETE.


The DROP command is quick to
perform but gives rise to complications. While this command is faster than DROP.


Q31 Why do we use Commit and Rollback command?
COMMIT ROLLBACK
COMMIT permanently saves the changes
made by the current transaction.


ROLLBACK undo the changes made by
the current transaction.


The transaction can not undo changes after
COMMIT execution.


Transaction reaches its previous state
after ROLLBACK.


When the transaction is successful, COMMIT
is applied.


When the transaction is aborted,
ROLLBACK occurs.
Q32 What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?
CHAR is a fixed-length character data type, while VARCHAR is a variable-length character
data type.
Q33What is the difference between DROP and TRUNCATE commands?
DROP command removes a table and it cannot be rolled back from the database whereas
TRUNCATE command removes all the rows from the table.
Q34 What is the default ordering of data using the ORDER BY clause? How could it be
changed?
The ORDER BY clause in MySQL can be used without the ASC or DESC modifiers. The sort
order is preset to ASC or ascending order when this attribute is absent from the ORDER BY
clause.
Q35 How do we use the DISTINCT statement? What is its use?
The SQL DISTINCT keyword is combined with the SELECT query to remove all duplicate
records and return only unique records. There may be times when a table has several
duplicate records.
The DISTINCT clause in SQL is used to eliminate duplicates from a SELECT statement’s
result set.
Q36 What are functions and their usage in SQL?
SQL functions are simple code snippets that are frequently used and re-used in database
systems for data processing and manipulation. Functions are the measured values. It always
performs a specific task. The following rules should be remembered while creating functions:
o A function should have a name, and the name cannot begin with a special character
such as @, $, #, or other similar characters.
o Functions can only work with the SELECT statements.
o Every time a function is called, it compiles.
o Functions must return value or result.
o Functions are always used with input parameters.
SQL categories the functions into two types:
o User-Defined Function: Functions created by a user based on their needs are termed
user-defined functions.
o System Defined Function: Functions whose definition is defined by the system are
termed system-defined functions. They are built-in database functions.


SQL functions are used for the following purposes:
o To perform calculations on data
o To modify individual data items
o To manipulate the output
o To format dates and numbers
o To convert data types
Q37 What is meant by case manipulation functions? Explains its different types in SQL.
Case manipulation functions are part of the character functions. It converts the data from the
state in which it is already stored in the table to upper, lower, or mixed case. The conversion
performed by this function can be used to format the output. We can use it in almost every
part of the SQL statement. Case manipulation functions are mostly used when you need to
search for data, and you don't have any idea that the data you are looking for is in lower case
or upper case.
There are three case manipulation functions in SQL:
LOWER: This function is used to converts a given character into lowercase. The following
example will return the 'STEPHEN' as 'stephen':
SELECT LOWER ('STEPHEN') AS Case_Reault FROM dual;
UPPER: This function is used to converts a given character into uppercase. The following
example will return the 'stephen' as 'STEPHEN':
SELECT UPPER ('stephen') AS Case_Reault FROM dual;
INITCAP: This function is used to converts given character values to uppercase for the initials
of each word. It means every first letter of the word is converted into uppercase, and the rest
is in lower case. The following example will return the 'hello stephen' as 'Hello Stephen':
SELECT INITCAP ('hello stephen') AS Case_Reault FROM dual;
Q38 Explain character-manipulation functions? Explains its different types in SQL.
Character-manipulation functions are used to change, extract, and alter the character string.
When one or more characters and words are passed into the function, the function will perform
its operation on those input strings and return the result.
The following are the character manipulation functions in SQL:
A) CONCAT: This function is used to join two or more values together. It always appends the
second string into the end of the first string. For example:
Input:
SELECT CONCAT ('Information-', 'technology') FROM DUAL;
Output: Information-technology
B) SUBSTR: It is used to return the portion of the string from a specified start point to an
endpoint. For example:
Input:
SELECT SUBSTR ('Database Management System', 9, 11) FROM DUAL;
Output: Management
C) LENGTH: This function returns the string's length in numerical value, including the blank
spaces. For example:
Input:
SELECT LENGTH ('Hello Javatpoint') FROM DUAL;
Output: 16


D) INSTR: This function finds the exact numeric position of a specified character or word in a
given string. For example:
Input:
SELECT INSTR ('Hello Javatpoint', 'Javatpoint');
Output: 7
E) LPAD: It returns the padding of the left-side character value for right-justified value. For
example:
Input:
SELECT LPAD ('200', 6,'*');
Output: ***200
F) RPAD: It returns the padding of the right-side character value for left-justified value. For
example:
Input:
SELECT RPAD ('200', 6,'*');
Output: 200***
G) TRIM: This function is used to remove all the defined characters from the beginning, end,
or both. It also trimmed extra spaces. For example:
Input:
SELECT TRIM ('A' FROM 'ABCDCBA');
Output: BCDCB
H) REPLACE: This function is used to replace all occurrences of a word or portion of the string
(substring) with the other specified string value. For example:
Input:
SELECT REPLACE ( 'It is the best coffee at the famous coffee shop.', 'coffee', 'tea');
Output: It is the best tea at the famous tea shop.
Q39 What is the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clauses?
The main difference is that the WHERE clause is used to filter records before any groupings
are established, whereas the HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group. The below
comparison chart explains the most common differences:
WHERE HAVING
This clause is implemented in row operations. This clause is implemented in column


operations.


It does not allow to work with aggregate
functions.


It can work with aggregate functions.


This clause can be used with the SELECT,
UPDATE, and DELETE statements.


This clause can only be used with the SELECT
statement.


Q39 What is the difference between the RANK() and DENSE_RANK() functions?
The RANK function determines the rank for each row within your ordered partition in the
result set. If the two rows are assigned the same rank, then the next number in the ranking
will be its previous rank plus a number of duplicate numbers. For example, if we have three
records at rank 4, the next rank listed would be ranked 7.
The DENSE_RANK function assigns a unique rank for each row within a partition as per the
specified column value without any gaps. It always specifies ranking in consecutive order. If
the two rows are assigned the same rank, this function will assign it with the same rank, and
the next rank being the next sequential number. For example, if we have 3 records at rank 4,
the next rank listed would be ranked 5.
Q40 What are SQL comments?
Comments are explanations or annotations in SQL queries that are readable by programmers.
It's used to make SQL statements easier to understand for humans. During the parsing of SQL
code, it will be ignored. Comments can be written on a single line or across several lines.
o Single Line Comments: It starts with two consecutive hyphens (--).
o Multi-line Comments: It starts with /* and ends with */.
Q41 List the different types of relationships in SQL.
There are different types of relations in the database:
One-to-One – This is a connection between two tables in which each record in one table
corresponds to the maximum of one record in the other.
One-to-Many and Many-to-One – This is the most frequent connection, in which a record in
one table is linked to several records in another.
Many-to-Many – This is used when defining a relationship that requires several instances
on each sides.
Self-Referencing Relationships – When a table has to declare a connection with itself, this
is the method to employ.
Q42 What is Auto Increment in SQL?
Autoincrement keyword allows the user to create a unique number to get generated
whenever a new record is inserted into the table.
This keyword is usually required whenever PRIMARY KEY in SQL is used.
AUTO INCREMENT keyword can be used in Oracle and IDENTITY keyword can be used in
SQL SERVER.
Q43Write the SQL query to get the third maximum salary of an employee from a table
named employees.
Employee table


employee_name salary
A 24000
C 34000
D 55000
E 75000
F 21000
G 40000
H 50000
SELECT * FROM(
SELECT employee_name, salary, DENSE_RANK()
OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC)r FROM Employee)
WHERE r=&n;
To find 3rd highest salary set n = 3


Q44 How to find the nth highest salary in SQL?
The most typical interview question is to find the Nth highest pay in a table. This work can be
accomplished using the dense rank() function.
Employee table


employee_name salary
A 24000
C 34000
D 55000
E 75000
F 21000
G 40000
H 50000
SELECT * FROM(
SELECT employee_name, salary, DENSE_RANK()
OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC)r FROM Employee)
WHERE r=&n;
Q45 Write a SQL query to find the names of employees that begin with ‘A’?
To display name of the employees that begin with ‘A’, type in the below command:
SELECT * FROM Table_name WHERE EmpName like 'A%'
Q46 What is the main difference between ‘BETWEEN’ and ‘IN’ condition operators?
BETWEEN operator is used to display rows based on a range of values in a row whereas the
IN condition operator is used to check for values contained in a specific set of values.
Example of BETWEEN:
SELECT * FROM Students where ROLL_NO BETWEEN 10 AND 50;
Example of IN:
SELECT * FROM students where ROLL_NO IN (8,15,25);
Q47 What is an ALIAS command?
ALIAS command in SQL is the name that can be given to any table or a column. This alias
name can be referred in WHERE clause to identify a particular table or a column.


For example-
Select emp.empID, dept.Result from employee emp, department as dept


where emp.empID=dept.empID;
Q48 What is a Stored Procedure?
A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused
over and over again.
So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored
procedure, and then just call it to execute it.
You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act
based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.
Q49 How to create a stored procedure using SQL Server?
A stored procedure is a piece of prepared SQL code that you can save and reuse again and
over.
So, if you have a SQL query that you create frequently, save it as a stored procedure and
then call it to run it.


You may also supply parameters to a stored procedure so that it can act based on the
value(s) of the parameter(s) given.
Stored Procedure Syntax
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
sql_statement
GO;
Execute a Stored Procedure
EXEC procedure_name;
to the 2nd highest salary set n = 2
To find 3rd highest salary set n = 3 and so on.
Q50 List some advantages and disadvantages of Stored Procedure?
Advantages:
A Stored Procedure can be used as a modular programming which means create once, store
and call for several times whenever it is required. This supports faster execution. It also
reduces network traffic and provides better security to the data.
Disadvantage:
The only disadvantage of Stored Procedure is that it can be executed only in the database
and utilizes more memory in the database server.
Q51 What is Triggers?
A trigger is a set of actions that are run automatically when a specified change operation
(SQL INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement) is performed on a specified table. Triggers
are useful for tasks such as enforcing business rules, validating input data, and keeping an
audit trail.
Q52 How many TRIGGERS are allowed in the MySQL table?
6 triggers are allowed in the MySQL table:
• BEFORE INSERT
• AFTER INSERT
• BEFORE UPDATE
• AFTER UPDATE
• BEFORE DELETE
• AFTER DELETE


TABLEAU INTERRVIEW QUESTIONS

to save your workbook or worksheets in the Tableau Server which can be viewed by anyone.
Q7 What are the different datatypes in Tableau?
Tableau supports the following data-types:


Q8 What are Measures and Dimensions?
Measures are the numeric metrics or measurable quantities of the data, which can be
analyzed by dimension table. Measures are stored in a table that contain foreign keys referring
uniquely to the associated dimension tables. The table supports data storage at atomic level
and thus, allows more number of records to be inserted at one time. For instance, a Sales
table can have product key, customer key, promotion key, items sold, referring to a specific
event.
Dimensions are the descriptive attribute values for multiple dimensions of each attribute,
defining multiple characteristics. A dimension table ,having reference of a product key form
the table, can consist of product name, product type, size, color, description, etc.


Q9 What is the difference between .twb and .twbx extension?
• A .twb is an xml document which contains all the selections and layout made you have
made in your Tableau workbook. It does not contain any data.
• A .twbx is a ‘zipped’ archive containing a .twb and any external files such as extracts
and background images.
Q10 Define LOD Expression?
LOD Expression stands for Level of Detail Expression, and it is used to run complex queries
involving many dimensions at the data sourcing level.
Q11 What are the different types of joins in Tableau?
The joins in Tableau are same as SQL joins. Take a look at the diagram below to
understand it.


Q12 How many maximum tables can you join in Tableau?
You can join a maximum of 32 tables in Tableau.
Q13 What are the different connections you can make with your dataset?
We can either connect live to our data set or extract data onto Tableau.
• Live: Connecting live to a data set leverages its computational processing and
storage. New queries will go to the database and will be reflected as new or updated
within the data.
• Extract: An extract will make a static snapshot of the data to be used by Tableau’s
data engine. The snapshot of the data can be refreshed on a recurring schedule as a
whole or incrementally append data. One way to set up these schedules is via the
Tableau server.
The benefit of Tableau extract over live connection is that extract can be used anywhere
without any connection and you can build your own visualization without connecting to
database.
Q14 What are sets?
Sets are custom fields that define a subset of data based on some conditions. A set can be
based on a computed condition, for example, a set may contain customers with sales over a
certain threshold. Computed sets update as your data changes. Alternatively, a set can be
based on specific data point in your view.
Q15 What are groups?
A group is a combination of dimension members that make higher level categories. For
example, if you are working with a view that shows average test scores by major, you may
want to group certain majors together to create major categories.
Q16 What are the supported data types in Tableau?
The following data types are supported in Tableau:


DataType Possible Values
Boolean True/False
Date Date Value (December 28, 2016)
Date & Time Date & Timestamp values (December 28, 2016


06:00:00 PM)


Geographical Values Geographical Mapping (Beijing, Mumbai)
Text/String Text/String
Number Decimal (8.00)
Number Whole Number (5)
Q17 What are shelves?
Tableau worksheets contain various named elements like columns, rows, marks, filters,
pages, etc. which are called shelves. You can place fields on shelves to create
visualizations, increase the level of detail, or add context to it.
Q18 What is a hierarchical field?
A hierarchical field in tableau is used for drilling down data. It means viewing your data in a
more granular level.
Q19 What are the different filters in Tableau and how are they different from each
other?
All the organizations use filters to reduce the size of the dataset and removing irrelevant
information to improve the performance or highlight the required information. In Tableau,
there are different ways to filter the dataset to increase data efficacy. Each filter is created
for different purposes and the order in which they are executed can change the performance
drastically. There are 6 types of filter used in Tableau sorted by order of execution;


1. Extract Filter
We can use extract filter while loading the dataset into Tableau, so it reduces the number of
times Tableau queries for the data source. We can further reduce the size of the data by
applying filters to the extract as required.
2. Data Source Filter
This filters any important or sensitive information that we want to control while loading the
data into Tableau. It works on both Live and Extract connection. We can add the data source
filter on any column by clicking on the ADD option.


After clicking on the ADD option, the ADD Filter dialog box will appear containing all the
fields, then we can select the field that we want to apply the filter on. We can also edit or
remove the data source filters as required.
3. Context Filters
The filters used in Tableau are normally the independent filters that produce their own result
but there are certain filters that are executed to process the records as returned by the first
filter. Context filter is an independent filter that creates a different worksheet out of the
original dataset and computes the calculation in the filtered dataset. It can be used to
improve the performance of large data sources. They can be created by dragging the
dimension to the filter section box and clicking on Add to context option. By clicking on this
the dimension will change to a grey color which is an indication of the context filter.


It can also be used to view Top N products in any particular category. We can also remove
the Context filter.
4. Dimension Filter
Fields in Dimension contain discrete categorical data and we can exclude or include the
values that we want to analyze. The process of adding the dimension filter is simple and is
given as follows;
• Drag the dimension from the dimension list to the filter section box.
• It will open a Filter Dialog box where we can select the values that we want to
analyze.


There are four tabs in the Filter dialog box:
1. General: To select the members present in the dimension that we want to include or
exclude.
2. Wildcard: To filter the result on the basis of a particular pattern. For e.g. if we want to
filter the email address of a particular domain then we can use the filter that ends
with “@yahoo.com” to include those email addresses.
3. Condition: To filter the result on the basis of a particular condition.
4. Top: To filter the Top N products of a particular category.
5. Measure Filters
Measure fields contain quantitative data and these filters are applied to the measure fields. It
can be applied by following the below procedure:
Drag the measured field from the Measure box to Filter section and a Filter dialog box will
open containing various operations.


Select the operation that needs to be performed and click Next. In subsequent dialog box
there are 4 types of filter:
1. Range: To select the range of values to include in the result.
2. At least: To select the minimum value of a measure to filter the data.
3. At most: To select the maximum value of a measure to filter the data.
4. Special: To select null or non-null values.
6. Table Calculation Filter
These filters are used when we do not want to filter the view without changing the underlying
data. Table Calculations are functions used when creating Calculated Fields such
as LOOKUP, WINDOW_SUM, WINDOW_AVG, etc.
Q20 How to create a calculated field in Tableau?
• Click the drop down to the right of Dimensions on the Data pane and select “Create >
Calculated Field” to open the calculation editor.
• Name the new field and create a formula.
Take a look at the example below:


Q21 What is a dual axis?
Dual Axis is an excellent phenomenon supported by Tableau that helps users view two scales
of two measures in the same graph. Many websites like Indeed.com and other make use of
dual axis to show the comparison between two measures and their growth rate in a septic set
of years. Dual axes let you compare multiple measures at once, having two independent axes
layered on top of one another. This is how it looks like:


Q22 What is disaggregation and aggregation of data?
The process of viewing numeric values or measures at higher and more summarized levels of
the data is called aggregation. When you place a measure on a shelf, Tableau automatically
aggregates the data, usually by summing it. You can easily determine the aggregation applied
to a field because the function always appears in front of the field’s name when it is placed on
a shelf. For example, Sales becomes SUM(Sales). You can aggregate measures using
Tableau only for relational data sources. Multidimensional data sources contain aggregated
data only. In Tableau, multidimensional data sources are supported only in Windows.
According to Tableau, Disaggregating your data allows you to view every row of the data
source which can be useful when you are analyzing measures that you may want to use both
independently and dependently in the view. For example, you may be analyzing the results
from a product satisfaction survey with the Age of participants along one axis. You can
aggregate the Age field to determine the average age of participants or disaggregate the data
to determine what age participants were most satisfied with the product.
Q23 What is the difference between joining and blending in Tableau?
• Joining term is used when you are combining data from the same source, for
example, worksheet in an Excel file or tables in Oracle database
• While blending requires two completely defined data sources in your report.
Q24 What is a blended axis?
Blended axis is the axis where multiple measures are shown in a single axis and all the
marks are shown in a single pane. We can blend measures by dragging the 1st measure on
one axis and the 2nd on the existing axis.
• Drag a dimension in a column
• Drag the first measure in the column
• Drag the second measure in the existing axis
• Us/multiplemeasures_blendedaxes.html


Q25 Give a brief about the tableau dashboard?
Tableau dashboard is a group of various views which allows you to compare different types
of data simultaneously. Datasheets and dashboards are connected if any modification
happens to the data that directly reflects in dashboards. It is the most efficient approach to
visualize the data and analyze it.
Q26 Define the story in Tableau?
The story can be defined as a sheet which is a collection of series of worksheets and
dashboards used to convey the insights of data. A story can be used to show the connection
between facts and outcomes that impacts the decision-making process. A story can be
published on the web or can be presented to the audience.
Q27 Define Bullet graph?
A bullet graph is a variant of Bar graph. It is responsible for comparing the performance of
one measure with other measures.
Q28 Define Gantt chart?
Gantt Chart displays the progress of value over the period. It consists of bars along with the
time axis. It is a project management tool. Here, each bar is a measure of a task in the
project framework.
Q29 Define a Histogram chart?
A histogram chart shows the distribution of continuous information over a certain period of
time. This chart helps us to find extreme points, gaps, unusual values, and more
concentrated values.
Q30 What is the Hierarchy in Tableau?
When we are working with large volumes of data, incredibly data may be messed. With
Tableau, you can easily create hierarchies to keep your data neat. Even if you don’t need it,
it is built into your data, which you can easily manage or organize the data and you can track
the data easily.


Q31 What is a Column chart?
A column chat visualizes the data as a set of rectangle columns, as their lengths are
proportional to values when they represent the data. The horizontal axis shows the category
to which they belong, and the vertical axis shows the values.


Q32 What is the Bar Chart in Tableau?
The bar chart visualizes the data as a set of rectangle bars, as their values are proportional
to lengths when they represent the data. The vertical axis shows the category to which they
belong to and the horizontal axis shows the values. So, the bar chart is a vertical version of
the Column chart.


Q33 What is the Line Chart?
The line chart is a popular type of diagrammatic way for visualizing the data, it connects the
individual data points to view the data. We can easily visualize the series of values, we can
see trends over time or predict future values. The horizontal axis holds the category to which
it belongs and the vertical axis holds the values.
Q34 What is a Stacked Bar chart?
Stacked Bar Chart, composed of multiple bars stacked horizontally, one below the other.
The length of the bar depends on the value in the data point. A stacked bar chart makes the
work easier, they will help us to know the changes in all variables presented, side by side.
We can watch the changes in their total and forecast future values.
Q35 What is a Stacked Column Chart?
Stacked Column Chart, composed of multiple bars stacked vertically, one on another. The
length of the bar depends on the value in the data point. A stacked column chart is the best
one to know the changes in all variables. This type of chart should be checked when the
number of series is higher than two.


Q36 What is an Area Chart?
An area chart is nothing but line chat, the area between the x-axis and lines will be color or
patterns. These charts are typically used to represent accumulated totals over time and are
the conventional way to display stacked lines
Q37 What is Context Filter and show the steps on how to create the Context Filter
Tableau?
Context Filters are applied to the data rows before any other filters. They are limited to
views, but they can be applied on selected sheets. They define Aggregation and
Disaggregation of data in Tableau
Step 1: Drag the subcategory dimensions to the row shelf and measure sales to the column
shelf. Now choose the horizontal bar chart as chart type and again drag the sub-category
dimensions to the filter shelf. Then we will get the following chart.
Step 2: Right-click on the Sub-Category field in the filter shelf and go to the Top fourth tab.
Choose the option field, from the next drop-down and choose the option Top 10 by Sales
Sum as shown in the following screenshot.
Step 3: Drag the dimension Category to the filter shelf. Give right-click on the general tab to
edit and under that choose Furniture from the list. As you can see the result shows three
subcategories of products.
Step 4: Right-click the Category: Furniture filter and select the option Add to Context. This
produces the final result, which shows the subcategory of products from the category
Furniture which are among the top 10 subcategories across all the products.
Q38 Differentiate parameters and filters in Tableau
Filters are the simpler and straightforward feature in Tableau. It applies to dimensions or
measures directly. For example, to only show Gujarat or Karnataka in a State dimension, we
can apply the filter on that. In Tableau, there are multiple UI options available for filters like
radio buttons, drop-down lists, checkboxes, sliders, and more. Filters on sheets are also
available in Tableau.
Filters, on the other hand, are used to restrict the data based on a condition that is
mentioned in the filters shelf.
Parameters are like variables. They are complex and more powerful. Like a variable, a
parameter can be used in calculations. So, that means, it only allows a single value.
Parameters have the same UI options except for checkboxes because checkboxes don’t
have a single value. For example, we can create a parameter for interest rate and period,
and then we can use these parameters to calculate interest and principal payments.
Parameters are dynamic values that can replace constant values in calculations. Parameters
can serve as filters as well.
Q39 Does a parameter have its own drop-down list?
Yes, it may have its own drop-down list. The entries one makes in a parameter while creating
it can be viewed as items in the drop-down list.
Q40 Tell me different ways to use parameters in Tableau
• Filters
• Calculated fields
• Actions
• Measure-swaps
• Changing views
• Auto-updates
Q41 Differentiate between Tiled and Floating in dashboards?
In a tiled layout, items don’t overlap. The layout will be adjusted according to dashboard
size. In the floating layout, items can be placed on some other layers. Floating items can
have fixed positions and sizes.


Q42 Differentiate discrete and continuous data roles in Tableau
Discrete data roles consist of values that are separate and distinct. Discrete data roles can
take individual values within a range. For Example – cancer patients in the hospital, no. of
threads in a sheet, state. Discrete values are displayed as blue icons in the data window and
blue pills on shelves. Discrete fields can be sorted.
Continuous data roles consist of any value within the finite or infinite intervals. For Example –
age, unit price, order quantity. Continuous values displayed as green icons in the data window
and green pills on shelves. Continuous fields cannot be sorted.
Discrete Continuous
Discrete data is the value that is counted
as distinct or separate.


Continuous data is used to measure
continuous data.


Only It can take individual values within a
range.


It can take any values within a finite and
infinite range.


Q43 Explain the disaggregation and aggregation of data in Tableau?
Aggregation → The process of summarizing the data and viewing a single numeric value is
called aggregation. Example – sum/avg of salary for each employee
Disaggregation →The process of viewing each transaction for analyzing all the measures
both dependently and independently. Example – individual salary transactions for each
employee.
Q44 State the components of the dashboard?
The dashboard consists of 5 components.
• Web: it consists of a web page embedded in the dashboard.
• Horizontal component: it is a horizontal layout container in which we can add
objects.
• Vertical component: it is a vertical layout container in which we can add objects.
• Image Extract: it allows you to upload an image to the dashboard from a computer.
• Text: it is a small Wordpad where we can format and edit the text.
Q45 What is the difference between the Tree map and Heat map?
Tree map Heat map
A treemap also does the same thing as well
as it can be used for illustrating hierarchical
data and part of whole relationships.


A heat map can compare categories with
color and size
In the heat map, you can compare two
different measures together.


Q46 What is the difference between Data Joining and Data blending?
Data joining Data blending
Data joining is used when you are combing
the data from the same source.


Data blending is required two completely
defined data sources in a report.


Q47 What are the different Tableau files?
o Bookmarks: It contains only single worksheet and its easy way to share your work.
o Workbooks: Workbook can hold one or more dashboards and worksheets.
o Packaged workbooks: It contains the workbook along with any supporting local file
data and background images.
o Data extraction files: Data extraction files are a local copy of a data source or a
subset.
o Data connection files: Data connection file is a small XML file that contain various
connection information.
Q48 What is the difference between the published data source and an embedded data
source?
Published data source Embedded data source
It contains connection information which is
independent of any workbook, and multiple
workbooks can use it.


It contains connection information, and it is
associated with a workbook.

Power Pivot is an add-on provided by Microsoft for Excel since 2010. Power Pivot was
designed to extend the analytical capabilities and services of Microsoft Excel.
Q6 What are filters in Power BI?
Filters sort data based on the condition applied to it. Filters enable us to select particular
fields and extract information in a page/visualization/report level. For example, filters can
provide sales reports from the year 2019 for the Indian region. Power BI can make
changes based on the filters and create graphs or visuals accordingly. Types of filters are:
• Page-level filters: These are applied on a particular page from various pages available
within a report.
• Visualization-level filters: These are applied to both data and calculation conditions for
particular visualizations.
• Report-level filters: These are applied to the entire report.
The following are the variety of filters available in Power BI:
• Manual filters
• Auto filters
• Include/Exclude filters
• Drill-down filters
• Cross Drill filters
• Drillthrough filters
• Drillthrough filters
• URL filters–transient
• Pass-Through filters
Q7 What is Visualization?
Visualization is a process to represent data in pictorial form like tables, graphs, or charts based
on the specific requirement.
Q8 What are Custom Visuals in Power BI?
Custom Visuals are like any other visualizations, generated using Power BI. The only
difference is that it developes the custom visuals using a custom SDK. The languages
like JQuery and JavaScript are used to create custom visuals in Power BI.
Q9 What is a Report?
The report is a Power BI feature that is a result of visualized data from a single data set. A
report can have multiple pages of visualization.
Q10 What is GetData in Power BI?

Some of the advantages of using Power BI:
• It helps build an interactable data visualization in data centers
• It allows users to transform data into visuals and share them with anyone
• It establishes a connection for Excel queries and dashboards for fast analysis
• It provides quick and accurate solutions
• It enables users to perform queries on reports using simple English words


Q12 List out some drawbacks/limitations of using Power BI.
Here are some limitations to using Power BI:
• Power BI does not accept file sizes larger than 1 GB and doesn't mix imported data
accessed from real-time connection ns.
• There are very few data sources that allow real-time connections to Power BI reports and
dashboards.
• It only shares dashboards and reports with users logged in with the same email address.
• Dashboard doesn't accept or pass user, account, or other entity parameters.
Q13 What are some differences in data modeling between Power BI Desktop and
Power Pivot for Excel?
Power Pivot for Excel supports only single directional relationships (one to many), calculated
columns, and one import mode. Power BI Desktop supports bi-directional cross-filtering
connections, security, calculated tables, and multiple import options.
Q14 Name the different connectivity modes available in Power BI?
There are three main connectivity modes used in Power BI.
SQL Server Import
An SQL Server Import is the default and most common connectivity type used in Power BI. It
allows you to use the full capabilities of the Power BI Desktop.
Direct Query
The Direct Query connection type is only available when you connect to specific data
sources. In this connectivity type, Power BI will only store the metadata of the underlying
data and not the actual data.
Live Connection
With this connectivity type, it does not store data in the Power BI model. All interaction with a
report using a Live Connection will directly query the existing Analysis Services model.
There are only 3 data sources that support the live connection method - SQL Server
Analysis Services (Tabular models and Multidimensional Cubes), Azure Analysis Services
(Tabular Models), and Power BI Datasets hosted in the Power BI Service.


Q15 What are the key differences between a Power BI dataset, a report, and a
dashboard?


Dataset Report Dashboard


A series of Power Query
queries that have been shaped
in a DAX model.


A series of visualizations,
filters, and static elements on
a canvas.


A way of pulling visualizations
together from several reports.


A Power BI dataset can have
many data sources.


Each report can have multiple
sheets.


A Power BI dashboard is a
single page, often called a
canvas, that uses
visualizations to tell a story.


A data set can have one report,
and a report can have one data
set.


The data set and your report


are going to have a one-to-
one relationship.


A dashboard is a tool for
pinning visuals from different
reports and other sources of
data.
Q16 Describe the components of Microsoft’s self-service BI solution.
Self-service business intelligence (SSBI) is divided into the Excel BI Toolkit and Power BI.


Q17 What is self-service BI, anyway?
SSBI is an abbreviation for Self-Service Business Intelligence and is a breakthrough in
business intelligence. SSBI has enabled many business professionals with no technical
or coding background to use Power BI and generate reports and draw predictions
successfully. Even non-technical users can create these dashboards to help their business
make more informed decisions.

Four important types of refresh options provided in Microsoft Power BI are as follows:
• Package refresh - This synchronizes your Power BI Desktop or Excel file between the
Power BI service and OneDrive, or SharePoint Online.
• Model or data refresh - This refreshes the dataset within the Power BI service with data
from the original data source.
• Tile refresh - This updates the cache for tile visuals every 15 minutes on the dashboard
once data changes.
• Visual container refresh - This refreshes the visible container and updates the cached
report visuals within a report once the data changes.
Q21 Name the data sources can Power BI can connect to?
Several data sources can be connected to Power BI, which is grouped into three main types:
• Files


It can import data from Excel (.xlsx, .xlxm), Power BI Desktop files (.pbix) and Comma-
Separated Values (.csv).


• Content Packs
These are a collection of related documents or files stored as a group. There are two
types of content packs in Power BI:
Content packs from services providers like Google Analytics, Marketo, or Salesforce and
Content packs are created and shared by other users in your organization.
• Connectors
Connectors help you connect your databases and datasets with apps, services, and data
in the cloud.
Q22 Explain how relationships are defined in Power BI Desktop?
Relationships between tables are defined in two ways:
• Manually - Relationships between tables are manually defined using primary and foreign
keys.
• Automatic - When enabled, this automated feature of Power BI detects relationships
between tables and creates them automatically


Q23 What is row-level security?
Row-level security limits the data a user can view and has access to, and it relies on filters.
Users can define the rules and roles in Power BI Desktop and also publish them to Power BI
Service to configure row-level security.


Q24 Explain the building blocks of Microsoft Power BI.
The important building blocks of Power BI are as follows:
Visualizations
Visualization is the process of generating charts and graphs for the representation of insights
on business data.
Datasets
A dataset is the collection of data used to create a visualization, such as a column of sales
figures. Dataset can get combined and filtered from a variety of sources via built-in data
plugins.
Reports
The final stage is the report stage. Here, there is a group of visualizations on one or more
pages. For example, charts and maps are combined to make a final report.
Dashboards
A Power BI dashboard helps you to share a single visualization with colleagues and clients
to view your final dashboard.
Tiles
A tile is an individual visualization on your final dashboard or one of your charts in your final
report.
Q25 What are the different views in Power BI Desktop?
There are three different views in Power BI, each of which serves a different purpose:
Report View: Users can add visualizations
and additional report pages and publish the
same on the portal from here.
Data View: Data shaping can be performed
through Query Editor tools.
Relationship View: Users can manage
relationships between datasets in this view.


Q26 What are the critical components of the Power BI toolkit?
The critical components of Power BI are mentioned below.
• Power Query
• Power Pivot
• Power View
• Power Map
• Power Q&A
• Power Query: It is one of the most important components of PowerBI to transform
data. Power Query helps to extract data from different data sources like Oracle, SQL,
Text/CSV files, Excel, etc. and even delete data from different sources.
• Power Pivot : It is used for data modeling that uses DAX ( Data Analysis
Expression) functions for the calculations. Relationships between different tables can
also be created here and we can get values that can be shown in Pivot Tables.
• Power View: The Power View is used for providing an intuitive display of the data
and retrieving the metadata for data analysis. The views are interactive in nature and
slicers and filters can be used for slicing and dicing the data.
• Power BI Desktop: Power Desktop is an integration tool for Power Query, Power
View, and Power Pivot. It helps to create advanced queries, data models, reports and
dashboards and helps in developing your BI skills for data analysis.
• Power BI Mobile Application: It is available for the Operating systems Android, iOS
and even Windows. The App has an interactive display of the dashboards which can
be shared as well.
• Power Map: It presents geo-spatial visualization of the data in 3 Dimensional Mode.
The data can be highlighted based on the geographical location which can be
continent, state, city or even street address.
• Power Q&A : It is used to provide answers to the questions asked by users. It works
with Power View and can be answered with representations by Power Q&A.
• Quick accessibility to data means there is no speed and memory issue
Q27 What are the Different Products in the PowerBI family?
Below are different Power BI services/products:
• Power BI Desktop
• Power BI Services
• Power BI Mobile
• Power BI Gateway
• Power BI Premium
• Power BI Report Server
• Power BI Embedded


Q28 What do you mean by grouping?
Power BI Desktop helps you to group the data in your visuals into chunks. You can,
however, define your groups and bins. For grouping, use Ctrl + click to select multiple
elements in the visual. Right-click one of those elements and, from the menu that appears,
choose Group. In the Groups window, you can create new groups or modify existing ones.


Q29 Explain responsive slicers in Power BI.
On a Power BI final report page, a developer can resize a responsive slicer to various sizes
and shapes, and the data collected in the container will be rearranged to find a match. If a
visual report becomes too small to be useful, an icon representing the visual takes its place,
saving space on the report page.
Q30 What is query folding in Power BI?
Query folding is used when steps defined in the Query Editor are translated into SQL and
executed by the source database instead of your device. It helps with scalability and efficient
processing.
Q31 What are the different stages in the working of Power BI?
There are three different stages in working on Power BI, as explained below.
1. Data Integration
2. Data Processing
3. Data Presentation
Data Integration
The primary step in any business intelligence is to establish a successful connection with the
data source and integrate it to extract data for processing.
Data Processing
The next step in business intelligence is data processing. Most of the time, the raw data also
includes unexpected erroneous data, or sometimes a few data cells might be empty. The BI
tool needs to interpret the missing values and inaccurate data for processing in the data
processing stage.
Data Presentation
The final stage in business intelligence is analyzing the data got from the source and
presenting the insights using visually appealing graphs and interactive dashboards.
Q32 What is the comprehensive working system of Power BI?
Power BI’s working system mainly comprises four steps:
Data Importing: The first step is to import the data and convert it into a standard format and
store it in a staging area.
Data Cleaning: After assembling the data, it requires transformation or cleaning to remove
unimportant values.
Data Visualization: Now the data is visually represented on the Power BI desktop as
reports and dashboards using powerful visualization tools.
Save and Publish: Finally when your report is ready you can save and publish these reports
that can be shared across users via mobile apps or web.
Q33 What are the types of visualizations in Power BI?
In PowerBI, we can represent the data in graphs and visualizations. The visualization can be
of any type, for example:
Bar and Column Charts: It is a standard visualization for looking at a specific value across
various categories.
Area Charts( Basic and Stacked ) : It is based on the line chart and the area under the
line. It depicts the magnitude of change over time.
Card: Card shows aggregate value of a certain datapoint, can be one or more but one per
row.
Doughnut and Pie Charts: They show the relation in parts of a whole. Doughnut charts
have a hollow in the centre while pie charts don’t.
Maps: To show categorical and quantitative data with spatial locations.
Matrix: It’s a type of table with easier display that shows aggregated data
Slicers: Slicer is used to filter other visuals on the page.
There are other visuals like Combo Charts, Decomposition Tree, Funnel charts, Gauge
charts, KPIs, Line Charts, Ribbon Chart, Scatter, Q&A, Tables, Treemaps, etc.


Q34 What is the difference between a Filter and a Slicer?
Filters are used to restrict users and not allow them to interact with dashboards or reports,
while the slicers are used to interact with dashboards and reports.
Q35 What is the difference between a new column and a new measure in Power BI?
In Power BI, a new column is an area where the physical data is stored when logic is applied.
On the other hand, the measure is where the calculations are performed on the fly based on
dimensions. The measure doesn't store any physical data like Column.
Q36 What are the different joins in Power BI?
There are mainly two types of joins in Power BI:
o Horizontal Joins: Horizontal Joins are used to append data from multiple tables.
o Vertical Joins: Vertical Joins are used to merge the data from multiple tables.
Q37 What are the various type of users who can use Power BI?
Ans: PowerBI can be used by anyone for their requirements but there is a particular group
of users who are more likely to use it:
Report Consumers: They consume the reports based on a specific information they need
Report Analyst: Report Analysts need detailed data for their analysis from the reports
Self Service Data Analyst: They are more experienced business data users. They have an
in-depth understanding of the data to work with.
Basic Data Analyst: They can build their own datasets and are experienced in PowerBI
Service
Advanced Data Analyst: They know how to write SQL Queries and have hands-on
experience on PowerBI. They have experience in Advanced PowerBI with DAX training and
data modelling.
measure Name
B- = – indicate beginning of formula
C- DAX Function
D- Parenthesis for Sum Function
E- Referenced Table
F- Referenced column name
Q38 What is DAX?
DAX stands for Data Analysis Expressions. It's a collection of functions, operators, and
constants used in formulas to calculate and return values. In other words, it helps you create
new info from data you already have.
Q39 What is the CALCULATE function in DAX?
The CALCULATE function evaluates the sum of the Sales table Sales Amount column in a
modified filter context. It is also the only function that allows users to modify the filter context
of measures or tables.
Moving ahead, you will step up to the following Power BI Interview Questions from the
Intermediate Level.
Q40 What are the three fundamental concepts of DAX?
Syntax
This is how the formula is written—that is, the elements that comprise it. The Syntax
includes functions such as SUM (used when you want to add figures). If the Syntax isn't
correct, you'll get an error message.
Functions
These are formulas that use specific values (also known as arguments) in a particular order
to perform a calculation, similar to the functions in Excel. The categories of functions are


date/time, time intelligence, information, logical, mathematical, statistical, text, parent/child,
and others.
Context
There are two types: row context and filter context. Row context comes into play whenever a
formula has a function that applies filters to identify a single row in a table. When one or
more filters are applied in a calculation that determines a result or value, the filter context
comes into play.
Name some commonly used tasks in the Query Editor.
• Connect to data
• Shape and combine data
• Group rows
• Pivot columns
• Create custom columns
• Query formulas
Q41 What are the most common DAX Functions used?
Below are some of the most commonly used DAX function:
• SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNTROWS, DISTINCTCOUNT
• IF, AND, OR, SWITCH
• ISBLANK, ISFILTERED, ISCROSSFILTERED
• VALUES, ALL, FILTER, CALCULATE,
• UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, NATURALINNERJOIN,
NATURALLEFTEROUTERJOIN,
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS, ISEMPTY,
• VAR (Variables)
• GEOMEAN, MEDIAN, DATEDIFF
Q42 What are the purpose and benefits of using the DAX function?
DAX or Data Analysis Expression is a functional language which can create calculated
columns and/or measures for smarter calculations to limit the data the dashboard has to
fetch and visualize.
Q43 How is the FILTER function used?
The FILTER function returns a table with a filter condition applied for each of its source table
rows. The FILTER function is rarely used in isolation, it’s generally used as a parameter to
other functions such as CALCULATE.
• FILTER is an iterator and thus can negatively impact performance over large source
tables.
• Complex filtering logic can be applied such as referencing a measure in a filter
expression.
o FILTER(MyTable,[SalesMetric] > 500)
Q44 What is the CALCULATE function in DAX?
The CALCULATE function measures the sum of a column from any table and can be
modified with Filters.
Syntax:
CALCULATE ( <Expression> [, <Filter> [, <Filter> [, ... ] ] ] )
Expression: The expression to be evaluated.
Filter: A boolean (True/False) expression or a table expression that defines a filter.


Q45 What is special or unique about the CALCULATE and CALCULATETABLE
functions?
These are the only functions that allow you modify filter context of measures or tables.
• Add to existing filter context of queries.
• Override filter context from queries.
• Remove existing filter context from queries.
Limitations:
• Filter parameters can only operate on a single column at a time.
• Filter parameters cannot reference a metric.
Q46 What is the common table function for grouping data?
SUMMARIZE()
• Main groupby function in SSAS.
• Recommended practice is to specify table and group by columns but not metrics.You
can use ADDCOLUMNS function.
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS
• New group by function for SSAS and Power BI Desktop; more efficient.
• Specify group by columns, table, and expressions.
Q47 What are some benefits of using Variables in DAX ?
DAX or Data Analysis Expression is a functional language which can create calculated
columns and/or measures for smarter calculations to limit the data the dashboard has to
fetch and visualise.
Q48 What is the difference between Distinct() and Values() in DAX?
Generally, the Distinct() and Values() functions are the same in Power BI. The only difference
between them is that the Values() function don't calculate null values, whereas the Distinct()
function calculates even the null values.
Q49 What is Power Query?
Power Query is a business intelligence tool designed by Microsoft for Excel. Power Query
allows you to import data from various data sources and will enable you to clean, transform
and reshape your data as per the requirements. Power Query allows you to write your query
once and then run it with a simple refresh.
Q50 Define Power Query?
Power Query is a business intelligence tool designed by Microsoft for Excel. Power Query is
an ETL tool that allows you to import data from various data sources and will enable you to
clean, transform and reshape your data as per the requirements. Power Query allows you to
write your query once and then run it with a simple refresh.
With this:
• You can import data from various sources like databases from files
• Append and join data from a wide range of sources
• You can shape data as needed by adding and removing it


Q51 How are a Power BI Dashboard and Report different from each other?
To understand the difference between Power BI Dashboard and Report, let’s run through
some quick points.
Capability Report Dashboard
Pages Can be of one or more pages. Consists of one page only
Data sources It has a single dataset per


report.


Can have data tiles from one or more
datasets or reports.


Filtering Can perform slicing, filtering,


and highlighting. Cannot filter or slice reports.
Set alerts No option for setting alerts. Enable setting email alerts
Featured reports No option for creating a
featured dashboard.


Enables to set only one dashboard as
a featured dashboard.


Accessing tables
and fields in datasets


Provides options to view
dataset tables, values, and
fields.


Cannot view or access underlying
datasets tables and fields.


Q52 What are the data destinations for Power Queries?
There are two destinations for output we get from power query:
1. Load to a table in a worksheet.
2. Load to the Excel Data Model.
Q53 What is query folding in Power Query?
Query folding is when steps defined in Power Query/Query Editor are translated into SQL and
executed by the source database rather than the client machine. It’s important for processing
performance and scalability, given limited resources on the client machine.
Q54 What are some common Power Query/Editor Transforms?
Changing Data Types, Filtering Rows, Choosing/Removing Columns, Grouping, Splitting a
column into multiple columns, Adding new Columns ,etc.
Q55 Can SQL and Power Query/Query Editor be used together?
Yes, a SQL statement can be defined as the source of a Power Query/M function for additional
processing/logic. This would be a good practice to ensure that an efficient database query is
passed to the source and avoid unnecessary processing and complexity
by the client machine and M function.
Q56 What are query parameters and Power BI templates?
Query parameters can be used to provide users of a local Power BI Desktop report with
a prompt, to specify the values they’re interested in.
• The parameter selection can then be used by the query and calculations.
• PBIX files can be exported as Templates (PBIT files).
• Templates contain everything in the PBIX except the data itself.
Parameters and templates can make it possible to share/email smaller template files and limit
the amount of data loaded into the local PBIX files, improving processing time and experience.


Q57 Which language is used in Power Query?
A new programming language is used in power query called M-Code. It is easy to use and
similar to other languages. M-code is case-sensitive language.
Q58 Why do we need Power Query when Power Pivot can import data from mostly used
sources?


Power Query is a self-service ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool which runs as an Excel add-
in. It allows users to pull data from various sources, manipulate said data into a form that suits


their needs and load it into Excel. It is most optimum to use Power Query over Power Pivot as
it lets you not only load the data but also manipulate it as per the users needs while loading.
Q59 Name some commonly used tasks in the Query Editor.
Some commonly used tasks in the Query Editor are:
Connect to Data: Get Data from various sources and Transform data.
Shape Data: Transform your data according to requirement to clean and shape it
Group Rows: You can group the values of many rows into one single value by summarizing
Pivot Columns: Pivot columns and create a table with aggregated values
Create Custom Columns: You can use custom formulas to create new columns in your table
Advanced Editor: You can make modifications to the data using Advanced Query Editor with

Document 27,35 Physician Interview Questions (With Example Answers),"﻿Physician interview questions and example answers
Here are some standard interview questions for physicians and advice on how to explain them with sample answers:


Can you tell me about changes you've made to your past practice that improved patient safety?
The interviewer will want to know how you initiate changes that improve overall outcomes and the care level for patients. Use examples from your experience to describe how you implemented new policies, brought on highly qualified health care staff or other methods of improving operations in a medical facility.


Example: ""In my last position, the hospital was understaffed and in need of qualified RNs for the ICU, which I would sometimes tend to. I communicated first with the nurse manager and her aide to discuss open interviews to look for qualified healthcare professionals to join our team. Over four weeks, we were able to hire six highly qualified nurses who added to the efficiency of patient care, which reduced errors and improved safety.""


What changes or improvements do you feel you can bring to our practice?
The interviewer may ask a question similar to this one as a way to evaluate how much you've researched their organization and how motivated you are to take initiative right away. Highlight your ability to problem-solve, approach challenges and find solutions that benefit patients and the organization.


Example: ""My first goal is to provide the best quality care for my patients, which means both upholding confidentiality and ensuring safety. I also feel that my knowledge and experience with interacting with patients through telehealth services enables me to add to the team's ability to reach its patients. My philosophy of maintaining compassionate and empathetic standards connects with your organization's as well and I feel that I would be an excellent fit here.""


Can you describe a time when you disagreed with a colleague about patient care?
This question tells the interviewer about your abilities to handle conflict in the workplace and come to resolutions that are agreeable for everyone involved. Showcase your interpersonal skills, ability to resolve conflict with others and build healthy relationships with a team.


Example: ""Recently, I disagreed with the lead physician about a medication they prescribed to a patient. I disagreed because I'd read a study that described various conditions that made it unsafe to prescribe. The patient had several of these same conditions, and rather than risk the outcome, I approached the lead physician to discuss my findings. The lead physician understood why I initially disagreed, and we discussed alternative treatments for the patient.""


What do you do if an emergency occurs while you're treating another patient?
The interviewer will likely want to get a sense of how you manage your time without taking away from patient care. In your answer, describe any of your past experiences that you've had dealing with emergencies while managing your patients and transitioning between duties in a fast-paced environment.


Example: ""I recently was treating a patient as a post-operative check-up when another patient down the hall suddenly went into cardiac arrest. The patient I was currently seeing still required care, however, they didn't need urgent care. I explained to them quickly that I would either come right back to them after assessing the situation or I would send my PA or one of our nurse practitioners to assist them in finishing their appointment.


I did have my PA assist with my patient while I administered emergency medical care for the other patient. However, they were very understanding and flexible. Sometimes emergencies happen, and I always will assist When I can without taking away from the quality of care I provide my patients.""


What is your process for presenting complicated information to patients?
Your answer to this question can give the interviewer insight into how you communicate with your patients to help them understand complex medical information. Use examples from your previous practice to describe how you discuss diagnoses, talk about treatment options and describe overall medical conditions with patients.


Example: ""When consulting with patients, I always suggest having a friend or family member present to help them process the information and offer support with asking questions. For instance, I recently treated a patient who required a spinal fusion due to a herniated disc. After performing an initial CT scan, and delivering my diagnosis and recommendation, I met with the patient and their spouse to go over the complicated procedure with them.


I explained the process of how we would do the fusion, what the disc replacement looks like and what it's made out of. I went over pre- and post-operation procedures and what they could expect in the days, weeks, months and years ahead with quality of life. The patient decided to proceed with the surgery based on my recommendations, and the surgery was a success.""",-0.13264205,0.15815154,0.27644005,-0.08440196,-0.10177585,0.19050197,-0.17794648,0.15353405,-0.13929918,0.033368316,0.025156245,-0.044293925,0.26547846,0.024977509,0.11867731,-0.30210108,0.17035785,0.059669614,-0.40913245,0.1808947,0.05771211,-0.15572709,0.13459228,0.015408376,0.08340347,-0.07485949,-0.09455506,-0.52248865,0.059976257,-0.10185153,-0.08518491,0.5234,-0.10968252,0.06446525,-0.032515474,0.29100564,-0.034555055,0.24900322,-0.03310263,-0.110194564,-0.3657459,-0.19932078,0.08389616,-0.36756033,-0.17688663,0.069544695,0.1044333,-0.27646127,-0.12476379,-0.72813463,0.09128622,-0.028174317,0.08267123,1.0436233,-0.103260785,-2.1607761,0.114322476,-0.31781784,1.5099748,0.45260552,-0.10841087,0.68076754,-0.15232757,0.06885509,0.7000989,0.025847625,0.38679862,0.29950038,0.18099882,-0.19561268,-0.05304151,-0.211163,-0.07104906,-0.38192368,0.23985584,0.102325425,-0.19809917,-0.054470308,-0.7366378,-0.1092971,0.58598274,0.1514165,-0.41204366,0.12978502,-1.482623,-0.12744674,0.17083624,0.01342689,-0.31962636,-0.32581818,-0.05590575,-0.1088413,-0.066186056,-0.0014110437,-0.42264783,0.02746751,-0.17779465,-0.31024572,0.52612305,0.18271671
Document 28,33 Law Firm Interview Questions and How To Answer Them,"﻿Sample interview questions and answers
Review these sample interview questions and answers to form your own responses:


1. Why do you want to practice law?
This question allows you to talk about what attracted you to the legal field. Your answer to this question can position you as the best person for the role and can provide the hiring partner with a glimpse of the knowledge and experience you can bring to the job. Employers want to hear how important this field is for you, so show your genuine interest in law when providing an answer.


Example: ""I want to practice law because I'm passionate about bringing justice to clients and upholding the law of our country. I believe it's important to be fair and unbiased, and I'd like to help someone experience that in their case. Being an attorney is more than filing paperwork with the court—it's a chance to represent someone who needs help.""
2. What are your strengths as a lawyer?
Employers want to know your strengths so they can see how you could work with their current team. Since your strengths are unique, you can use your response to stand out from other candidates. Answer this question by relating your strengths to the job you're applying for and the tasks you expect to be responsible for. Use the STAR technique to give a specific example of your strengths.


Example: ""One of my biggest strengths is perseverance. I once represented a client who filed a suit against their employer for failing to pay for injuries they sustained while on the job. It was a difficult case to gather evidence since no employees claimed to witness the accident and there was no video footage. After performing some in-depth research and interviewing several employees, I was able to find out that there was a delivery driver present who corroborated my client's story. Thankfully, we were able to settle quickly after that.""
3. What do you want your clients to know about you?
This question helps a hiring partner understand more about your client relations. Think about how you want a client to feel after an interaction with you in the office or courtroom. Consider what attributes you have and how you work that makes a client happy to have you represent them. Employers want to make sure that you treat clients well and represent their law firm in a positive light.


Example: ""I want my clients to know that I'll work hard in their case because they matter to me. I care a lot about their personal outcome and do my due diligence in researching their issue to offer solutions, file the appropriate paperwork and represent them in disputes. My clients should know that I am their advocate, and they can be honest with me about their situation and take comfort in the fact that I'm providing a safe space for them.""
4. Describe your approach in the courtroom.
How you perform in the courtroom can be the determining factor in winning your case. Answering this question is your chance to share how you interact with members of the court, present your case and represent your client. Give a detailed, step-by-step answer that shows exactly how you prepare and work in a courtroom.


Example: ""Either the night before or the morning of a case, I study all of my notes so I'm fully prepared for the trial. I make sure any witnesses or evidence I need to present are confirmed. I usually take an aggressive stance during proceedings so my client gets fair representation. When the opposing side is presenting, I take thorough notes so I can counter effectively.""",-0.114314616,0.17987409,0.31150493,-0.17803936,-0.11653727,0.21014033,-0.24890128,0.14635408,-0.10878904,0.014147979,0.07371465,-0.013603555,0.24661076,0.0031113527,0.048014425,-0.2840356,0.19691359,0.16167748,-0.42940807,0.26168132,0.11720392,-0.14100046,0.16147755,-0.04381261,0.09695183,-0.08844281,-0.07262663,-0.5087521,0.08811714,-0.15438575,-0.04101905,0.53382415,-0.039676644,0.028573602,0.014669645,0.2710319,-0.0127988495,0.21452124,0.05496477,-0.16683584,-0.37246275,-0.22036235,0.1294035,-0.39887717,-0.23018953,0.0076531954,0.1410284,-0.34364596,-0.11495631,-0.8256806,0.10890404,-0.03135357,0.1503368,1.064491,-0.16170998,-2.2477386,0.107065186,-0.32261586,1.6337067,0.41201487,-0.1615454,0.7753787,-0.23876382,0.040609796,0.8126467,-0.02275816,0.4715101,0.33413085,0.10706394,-0.2098561,-0.038824275,-0.2253136,-0.07144936,-0.4409677,0.20782664,0.09594932,-0.18444374,-0.12820357,-0.7893207,-0.047643483,0.59219736,0.12032173,-0.42354086,0.058096707,-1.4286791,-0.2138999,0.12672652,-0.012420413,-0.21928515,-0.36815342,-0.07791152,-0.06677913,-0.023844035,-0.047813494,-0.37982,-0.042686384,-0.19837415,-0.33951688,0.55196613,0.28283805
Document 29,50 Teacher Interview Questions (With Sample Answers),"﻿Most common teacher interview questions
Here are some common interview questions for teachers, as well as advice on how to craft your response. Remember, the interviewer is interested not only in the content of your answer but also in your overall ability to be clear, approachable and engaging:


1. Why do you want to teach?
When you're asked this question during an interview, you'll have an opportunity to discuss your dedication to teaching. Every teacher has their reasons for entering this profession so feel free to provide personal anecdotes in your answer. Be sure to explain your passion for teaching and any person or experience that inspired you to enter the profession.


Example answer: “I became a teacher because of my high school algebra teacher’s impact on my life. Math doesn’t come naturally to me but she took the time not only to explain the material in a way that made sense to me but also helped me understand that every form of intelligence is equally valuable. There’s no job more important than teaching the future leaders of our world the information they need to know, but more importantly, showing them their worth, potential and ability to form their own opinions by thinking critically and observing the world around them.”


2. What makes you a good fit for this school?
This question reveals whether you researched the school and district. Conducting thorough research about the student body, how the community views the school, test scores and other aspects of the school district shows you're serious about the position.


When answering this question, demonstrate your knowledge of both the school and its district. Explain why this information enhances your interest in the institution. A strong answer could include information about recent test scores, specific programs or awards earned by the school.


Example answer: “I am inspired by this school’s reputation for educational excellence and for encouraging creativity through its renowned arts program. I note there has been a dip in the AP test scores in recent years, so I am extremely motivated to introduce my teaching strategies. I feel confident that I could help students improve their scores and opportunities for success.”


3. What characteristics do students want their teachers to possess?
Every teacher has a unique way of teaching but different students thrive under different teaching styles so a teacher must be adaptable. A good answer explains what characteristics you think are most important for a teacher to possess, how these traits benefit students and how you cultivate those qualities in yourself.


Example answer: “I believe that students want their teachers to be dedicated and approachable, and they can tell when a teacher doesn't possess these qualities. If students know you're working hard and want to support them as they learn, they're more likely to succeed. For this reason, I keep an open-door policy at all times and strive to build rapport with each student.”
4. How does a teacher's personality affect their success?
This allows you to share your vision of success and the tools needed to achieve it. A good answer would describe some of the personal qualities teachers need to succeed as well as some of the obstacles to success they must overcome.


Example answer: “Teachers need to have flexibility, compassion, self-discipline, drive and patience to reach their students. Teachers also need to consider state and local testing objectives when devising lesson plans and making sure students understand the materials on which they'll be tested. Teachers must be able to alter their styles so that every one of their students can learn effectively.”


5. What role does discipline play in teaching and what is your approach?
Teachers must handle issues with discipline from time to time and how discipline is addressed is an especially important aspect of elementary teaching interviews. Discipline is a vital part of controlling a classroom and depends on the age of the students, district policies and teaching style. To answer this question, you should carefully describe your approach to discipline and how handling it correctly can affect the classroom.


Example answer: “I believe that a teacher can't be effective without the right disciplinary approach. I prefer to explain what's expected of my students, so they're set up for success. Without discipline, there won't be respect, and keeping students accountable may be difficult. After researching several methods, I’ve found that a rewards system is the best method for avoiding bad behavior. While there are certainly still cases that need to be addressed with the school’s behavior program, using rewards enforces positive behavior and gives children a goal to strive for.”


6. How do you incorporate parents/guardians into students' education?
You may be asked this question to determine how you would facilitate relationships with students' parents. Parents are vital to their child's educational success and teachers must communicate with parents clearly and effectively. A good answer will emphasize a parent's role in their child's education and will explain how you plan to involve parents.


Example answer: “A child's education depends on the support of his or her parents. I believe that engaging with parents and making sure that they have an active role in their child's success is vital. I give parents my contact information so they can get in touch and ask any questions they have about how their child is performing. I also provide updates about what my students have learned and accomplished.”


7. Have your lesson plans been affected by standardized testing at the state levels?
Preparing for standardized testing is a crucial part of the teaching profession, especially for those in public education. When answering this question, you should describe how you incorporated different standards into your lesson plan but also how you developed a robust curriculum that wasn't based on testing standards alone.


Example answer: “You must take standards into account when developing a curriculum. Successfully structuring a school year depends on effectively planning a curriculum and regularly assessing students. My approach is to develop lessons by building them around educational standards, but I don't only teach with testing in mind. My lesson plans include more information than just what the students need to know for the standardized test. Regular assessments let me gauge how well my students understand the material, and I use my curriculum to make sure my students have acquired the skills that they'll need for the test.”


8. What do you believe is the role of technology in the classroom?
Many teachers now incorporate technology into their lessons. Your answer should explain your thoughts on technology and how that translates to your teaching. Many teachers aim to use available technology without letting it take over the classroom.


Example answer: “I think that technology in the classroom can be a valuable tool in helping students learn. That being said, technology can also be distracting, so setting expectations for appropriately using tech is critical. Students should be able to use the technology for learning in addition to basic skills so I give them assignments that require advanced use of the technology to complete the work. For example, I may include formatting requirements with their writing assignments, so they're progressively learning to format throughout the year. This allows the students to become more comfortable with different platforms and sets them up for success in their future workplace.”


9. Tell me about your teaching philosophy.
It is common for employers to inquire about your teaching methods and philosophies to determine if you’d be a good fit for their school. Many schools may have established ways of teaching and you must express your openness and confidence in your own cultivated opinions about the best ways to teach.


Example answer: “My teaching philosophy is to make my lesson plans relatable. In many cases, when a student can’t identify with the material, it’s harder for them to gather meaning. As a literature teacher, my goal is to help students empathize with characters, places and concepts, especially when those things are different from their own life experiences. As a student, I found stories more memorable when my teachers helped me draw parallels. As a student teacher, I like to make comparisons between older texts, like Shakespeare and modern events. For example, comparing events in the plays to events in pop culture. This not only helps students understand the stories but also helps them draw their own conclusions.”
10. How would your past students, peers or administrators describe you?
This question is used to learn more about your personality and self-awareness. Employers may compare your answer to how your references described you. A thorough and thoughtful answer can show strong interpersonal skills and perceptiveness. Use anecdotes and examples from your experience to support your answer.


Example answer: ""My peers and students would describe me as encouraging, creative and inspiring. I love planning fun activities for my classroom and involving other classrooms as well. For example, last year I organized 'Pi Day' on March 14 for the whole six-grade class. I planned scavenger hunts, relay races and trivia all based on math. It was great to see all the students work together, have fun and learn.""


11. What questions do you have for us?
This question is typically asked at the end of the interview and is a critical part of the interview. Asking thoughtful and researched questions shows your interest in the position and supports a memorable final impression. Come prepared to the interview with five to 10 questions and jot down or make a mental note of any new questions that arise throughout the interview.


Example questions: ""How would you describe the culture of the school? What qualities do you look for in a candidate? What are some of the school’s greatest achievements? What extracurricular activities are offered to students?""",-0.09178782,0.24250285,0.25858134,-0.11021455,-0.06370068,0.17884296,-0.2368866,0.14062236,-0.14328858,0.1104349,0.01249448,-0.09727949,0.24559656,0.026842456,0.056029573,-0.26831806,0.2070172,0.14619987,-0.44655028,0.25898463,0.057226308,-0.16438486,0.2133966,-0.03835293,0.07779938,-0.1528828,-0.093698226,-0.47052753,0.013714556,-0.08650188,-0.1476944,0.5332236,-0.1176748,0.032668985,0.0016778148,0.24762519,-0.040516663,0.23477015,-0.09437836,-0.14598598,-0.41851488,-0.21235205,0.054936748,-0.32141,-0.20000991,0.0017974289,0.19631967,-0.29268909,-0.09833034,-0.7338031,0.040938884,-0.048897136,0.06741298,1.0634493,-0.13212463,-2.2144532,0.15086587,-0.3010176,1.5738131,0.35899428,-0.1391397,0.76122445,-0.18363437,0.05237039,0.7410643,0.009564257,0.41356555,0.28081247,0.2323949,-0.19955301,-0.004504194,-0.21133532,-0.049095802,-0.39386997,0.12812875,0.11688921,-0.15662985,-0.06181885,-0.7668242,-0.100789696,0.52302885,0.10397274,-0.44231036,0.03298222,-1.452717,-0.105640665,0.08045655,-0.082920834,-0.2199095,-0.32942033,-0.1146413,-0.04943988,-0.064182475,0.03732441,-0.47140744,-0.043356486,-0.2653478,-0.4068892,0.5611448,0.30367693
Document 30,30 Interview Questions Every Teacher Must Be Able To Answer (Plus 5 To Ask!),"﻿1. Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It seems like a trite softball question, but don’t let that fool you. Most administrators are looking for something more than “I’ve just always loved kids.” If you don’t have a substantive answer, then why are you even applying? Schools want to know you are dedicated to enriching the lives of students. Answer honestly with anecdotes or examples that paint a clear picture of the journey that you took to become a teacher.


2. How do you cope with stress?
This one didn’t always appear on older lists of common teacher interview questions and answers, but it’s showing up now big time. School administrators are well aware of the toll teaching in today’s world takes on educators’ mental health and wellness. While they, hopefully, are taking steps to help their teachers deal with the stress and challenges of the job, they want to know if you have coping strategies in place. This is a great place to talk about hobbies, family/friends, and anything else outside the job that you turn to when things get tough. It’s important to note that this is also a great opportunity for you to ask the interviewer what steps their district has taken to prioritize teacher health and wellness.


3. What is your teaching philosophy?
This is one of the most common, as well as one of the trickiest, teacher interview questions. Don’t answer with a clichéd, generic response. In fact, your response is your teaching mission statement. It’s the answer to why you’re a teacher. It’s helpful if you write out your mission statement before the interview and practice reciting it. Discussing your teaching philosophy is a chance to show off why you’re passionate, what you want to accomplish, and how you are going to apply it in this new position, in a new classroom, at a new school.


4. How do you incorporate social-emotional learning in your lessons?
Many states and districts have added requirements for social-emotional learning into their standards. Explain how you will not only tend to the academic needs of your students but tie in lessons that satisfy the core SEL competencies. Describe how you will help students build their self- and social-awareness skills, how you will support them in building relationships, and how you will give them the skills to make responsible decisions.
5. How do you use technology in the classroom?
Technology is at the forefront of education, so your interview is the time to show off that you’re savvy. Talk about why you’re excited to use technology with students. How did you manage remote classrooms and engage students? What technology did you incorporate and use while teaching at home and in the classroom? Your administration needs teachers who are tech-savvy and have innovative thinking around technology.


6. Describe your classroom management structure.
If you’re a veteran teacher, discuss how you handled your classroom in the past. Give specific examples of things that worked the best and why. If you’re new, then explain what you learned as a student teacher and how you’ll map out a plan to run your first classroom. No matter how long you’ve been teaching, familiarize yourself with the school district’s philosophies on classroom management and discipline. Mention how you’ll incorporate their philosophy and stay true to your own. If you’re unable to find out much about the school’s policies beforehand, ask the interviewer to explain.


7. How do you feel about classroom observations and walk-throughs?
This one sounds simple, but be careful. It’s fine to say observations make you nervous, but most administrators want teachers who are comfortable with other adults seeing what goes on in their classroom. This is a great chance to talk about how exciting you find it to share all the wonderful learning activities that happen in your classroom with students’ parents and administration, even if you still get a bit nervous when being observed by other adults.


8. Do you think students are different than they were before COVID-19? What changes have you observed, and how have you dealt with them in your classroom?
While these teacher interview questions have only been asked in more recent years, they’re becoming common, so it’s important to prepare your answers. They might actually be easier if you’re interviewing for your first teaching job. If that’s you, feel free to explain that while you don’t have a basis for comparison that others might, your classroom management plan is set up with today’s kids in mind.


If, however, you’re a veteran teacher, take more time to prep for these questions. Many educators have been quite vocal about the negative emotional, behavioral, and mental changes they’ve noticed in their students post-COVID. If you’ve had similar experiences, you can be honest about them. But make sure you explain what steps you’ve taken to address these changes in a proactive and positive way. No school district wants to hire a teacher who is going to throw up their hands and proclaim, “These kids just don’t listen anymore!” Let them know you are going to meet your students where they are and help them reach your high standards.


9. What did you like/dislike about working remotely?
If you were working or going to school during the pandemic, you’re likely going to be asked about how you dealt with the challenges of working remotely. Be honest. If you hated teaching via Zoom and couldn’t wait to get back to in-person instruction, you can say so. You may want to add, however, that you appreciated the opportunity to learn more about how technology could be used to engage different learners. Similarly, if you loved teaching from home, but you’re applying for an in-person position, you may want to be clear about the fact that while you loved being able to be at home, you love building relationships with your students in-person more.


10. What impact does trauma have on student learning? How do you address this in your classroom?
Whew, questions like these are tough. As our understanding of the role trauma plays in learning grows, the need for educators to know about it and how to deal with it in their classrooms does as well. If you’ve received professional development on the topic, this is a perfect opportunity to show off a bit. If not, take some time to learn more about how trauma can affect not only students but the individuals who work with them. That way, you’ll feel more comfortable discussing the issue when it comes up.


11. What role do you believe diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives should play in your classroom and in the school?
Questions about DEI initiatives, policies, and mindsets are challenging but have definitely become standard in most teacher interviews. Many school districts want to know that incoming educators are open to having the challenging conversations and doing the difficult work of building anti-racist curriculum and policies. In more traditional districts, interviewers might be on the lookout for teachers whose views might be “too progressive” for the parents in their schools. Answer these questions truthfully. If you feel strongly that anti-racist policies are important and want DEI initiatives to be respected and valued in the district where you work, you should know that before you accept a teaching position.


12. How will you encourage parents to support their children’s education?
The home-school connection is imperative yet tough to maintain. Administrators lean on teachers to keep open lines of communication with parents. They even see you as a “publicist” for the school, reinforcing the culture, strengths, and values of the school to parents. So, answer this question with concrete ideas. Share how parents will volunteer in your classroom and how you’ll maintain regular contact, providing updates on both positive and negative events. It’s great to also share your plan for providing resources to parents when students are struggling.


13. What are some methods you use to check for understanding as you’re teaching?
It’s one thing to prepare a high-quality lesson plan, but if students are not following along, what’s the use? Explain how your instruction will be responsive to students’ needs. Will you incorporate tech tools for assessments? Or implement exit slips summarizing what they’ve learned? Do you have a quick-check method, like thumbs-up/thumbs-down, to quickly scan for understanding?


14. How do you assess students’ progress?
Here’s your chance to preview your lesson plans and reveal your methods for keeping on top of students’ social, academic, and physical development. Explain the types of quizzes you give because you know that they’re most telling about students’ strengths and weaknesses. Give insight into how you use oral reports, group projects, and seat work to determine who’s struggling and who’s ahead. And share how you implement open communication with your students to discover what they need to succeed.


15. What are your thoughts about grades?
Grading and assessment are set to become hot topics in education in the next few years. While many feel that we’ve become lax in grading during the pandemic and want to tighten up traditional grading, others are arguing for drastically changing our grading systems. Regardless of what you believe personally about this issue, it’s a good idea to start by knowing how the district you are interviewing in handles grades. You can (and should!) absolutely discuss how you believe standards-based grading to be superior to traditional methods, but make sure you also state that you can and will follow district protocols and believe you can accurately measure student learning in this way.


16. Why do you want to teach at this school?
Research, research, and research more before your interview. Google everything you can about the school. Do they have a theater program? Are the students involved in the community? What type of culture does the principal promote? Use social media to see what the school proudly promoted most recently. Then, ask around. Use your network of colleagues to find out what (current and former) teachers loved and hated about it. The point of all this digging? You need to know if this school is a good fit for you. If it is a good fit, you’ll demonstrate how much you want the job by explaining how you would get involved with all the amazing school programs you’ve heard so much about!


17. What is the greatest challenge facing teachers today?
Remote learning? Hybrid learning? Diversity and inclusion? Social-emotional learning? Engaging parents? The challenges are plenty! Think about your specific school, district, city, and state. What issue is most pressing, and what can you, as a teacher, do to help?


18. How would you handle a parent challenging your teaching methods/curriculum/classroom management?
Even a district that is going to strongly support its teachers against parent complaints may ask how you will handle such conflicts when they arise. This is a great opportunity to discuss how you stay calm in tense situations. Discussing how you prefer to call parents who are upset rather than emailing, or how you would forward particularly angry emails to a supervisor just to keep everyone in the loop, are excellent ways to show that you are a calm and proactive educator.
19. How can you meet the needs of a student with an IEP?
Today’s inclusive classrooms require that teachers know how to meet each child’s unique educational needs, especially those with disabilities. Perhaps most importantly, meeting the needs of students with IEPs (and 504 plans) is required by law. Districts definitely want to hear that you know that and you will be following those legal requirements. Even if you have not worked extensively with special needs students, educate yourself on the process and be familiar with the lingo. Prepare a couple of examples of ways you can differentiate instruction to support their particular needs.


20. How would you handle a situation in which you believe a student doesn’t need all of the accommodations listed in their IEP?
This is a variation of the last question, and it’s also a bit of a “gotcha” question. It’s important to remember that special education paperwork is legally binding. If an IEP states that a student gets extended time to complete work, preferential seating, or any other specially designed instruction, they have to receive it, or the district has broken the law. An administrator or principal who asks this question wants to know that you are aware of how important following a student’s IEP is and that you won’t ignore things when you don’t think they are needed. Make sure you express that you understand that.


Want to make your answer even stronger? Acknowledge that part of your job as a teacher is to monitor how a student is performing and let the student’s case manager (or whoever is writing their IEP) know if you believe they do not need a particular support or if they need more. This way, you demonstrate a strong understanding of how the IEP works and that you play an important role as a member of that students’ support team.


21. How will you meet the needs of the students in your class who are advanced or say they’re bored?
School leaders don’t want to hear canned responses about how you can differentiate; they want you to give some concrete answers and support your ideas. Perhaps you help get kids prepared for scholastic competitions once they’ve mastered the standard (spelling bee or chemistry olympiad, anyone?). Maybe you offer more advanced poetry schemes for your English classes or alternate problem-solving methods for your math students. Whatever it is, make sure that you express the importance that all students are engaged, even the ones who are already sure to pass the state standardized test.


22. How will you engage reluctant learners?
Teaching in an age when we must compete with TikTok, Snapchat, and other forms of instant entertainment makes this question valid and necessary. How will you keep students engaged? Share specific incentive policies, lessons you’ve used, or ways you’ve built relationships to keep students on task. An anecdote of how a past student (remember to protect privacy) that you taught was turned on to your subject because of your influence would also help your credibility here.


23. Describe a troubling student you’ve taught. What did you do to get through to them?
This question addresses more than just your reluctant learners. This speaks to any discipline measures you’ve had to address. As a teacher, you need to control the classroom and provide a safe space for all of your students. Think about your approach to troubling students and any successes you’ve had in the past.


24. Tell us about a mistake you made with a student. What happened, and how did you address it?
This is one of those tough but important teacher interview questions that’s more common than you may think. Your interviewer is asking you to be a bit vulnerable here, but be careful with your choice of anecdote. While we’ve all made mistakes when dealing with students, what you’re really looking for is an example where you made a mistake and then addressed it appropriately. Think carefully about a situation in which you didn’t handle things as well as you could have, but you got it right in the end. Explain why you handled it the way you did initially, what caused you to reflect and change your mind, and how the situation was resolved.


25. Which activities, clubs, or sports are you willing to sponsor if you are offered a position?
While this expectation may be more real for middle and secondary teachers, being the new kid on the block often comes with a conversion of your title from teacher to coach. If athletics isn’t one of your strengths, you can still get an edge on your competition by sponsoring a science club, yearbook, or academic team. You might also share a special skill, like knitting or creative writing, and offer to teach it to interested students.


26. What three words would your peers, administrators, or students use to describe you?
Having been caught off-guard by this prompt at a previous competitive interview, I would encourage you to have some thoughtful options to describe yourself. It’s tempting to say things you think your new boss might want to hear, like intelligent or hardworking, but don’t discount character traits or terms that paint you as a team player among peers and a role model for students. Some options to consider are empathetic, creative, caring, or cooperative.


27. What do you feel you can contribute to our school’s PLC for your subject?
The days of shutting your door to do your own thing are out, and professional learning communities are in! Go in ready to discuss topics such as common planning, benchmarks, and data analysis. This is a key time to highlight your strengths. Whether you shine in making high-level DOK assessment questions or have a plethora of student-centered activities for your subject, let the interviewers know what you have to offer to your prospective peers and what you hope to glean from collaborating with them.


28. Which component of your résumé are you most proud of and why?
Pride may come before a fall, but if asked about your accomplishments, don’t be bashful about conveying your worth. Have you won a grant for classroom materials? Share the details and how they helped your students succeed. Did you receive an award for excellence in instruction? Talk about how the application process helped you reflect and grow. If you’re a recent graduate, you can still brag on yourself: Describe your student-teaching experience and how it prepared you for opportunities like the job opening you’re vying for. Small things, like professional organization memberships, can also help you relay your interest in staying up-to-date on the latest educational research and best professional development.


29. What are you learning right now?
It’s no secret that successful teachers pursue professional development opportunities whenever they get the chance. Share a PD book you’ve been reading, a recent TED talk that inspired you, or something new about your subject matter you’ve been brushing up on. Show your interviewers that you’re engaged in exploring new information and always willing to learn.


30. Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years?
Universally, this is probably one of the most common interview questions, and a teacher should definitely be prepared to answer it. With more teachers leaving the classroom than ever before, many districts are going to be looking for educators who are ready to stay put for the foreseeable future. That being said, if your dream is to become a principal, reading specialist, or some other role within the district, it’s OK to mention that. However, it’s probably wise to state that your main goal is to be the best classroom teacher you can be and see what opportunities arise after 5 or 10 years.",-0.116891354,0.27612603,0.31334466,-0.18856609,-0.110248685,0.20171481,-0.24806319,0.18034756,-0.09110649,0.03866456,0.050022155,-0.060757536,0.2489008,0.036868975,0.07699375,-0.27694765,0.18505624,0.16198082,-0.4453475,0.2773828,0.08922612,-0.090751804,0.18191153,-0.07147812,0.10495312,-0.11169303,-0.12069297,-0.49952692,0.06212424,-0.13962157,-0.11993532,0.5498664,-0.058212508,0.04517411,0.02631075,0.2850912,-0.0499709,0.21325561,0.021473568,-0.16929424,-0.39949244,-0.21071872,0.05442077,-0.38494465,-0.21785651,0.02680467,0.16349562,-0.2946065,-0.09530184,-0.7750746,0.03360949,-0.08006765,0.07710332,1.0359763,-0.16944474,-2.265359,0.13701883,-0.26182523,1.586368,0.4102061,-0.14522451,0.7904565,-0.24265072,0.039481692,0.7675788,0.028655285,0.47579807,0.34315166,0.17055349,-0.21695064,-0.0037465198,-0.26961404,-0.07950889,-0.4111269,0.12470747,0.10090307,-0.13537873,-0.051686104,-0.73965317,-0.08137329,0.5303971,0.045263004,-0.4898626,0.033924382,-1.4529335,-0.14940389,0.09534657,-0.07145865,-0.21919695,-0.3715261,-0.09368195,-0.057017703,-0.06518116,-0.032243032,-0.49844745,-0.04622563,-0.21046112,-0.35636145,0.5448888,0.300634
Document 31,Top 35 Marketing Interview Questions (Example Answers Included),"﻿1. When a next-generation product hits the market, how do you position a legacy product to ensure its long-term success?
When the newest version releases, companies don’t necessarily remove the legacy product or service from the market. Hiring managers ask this question to see how a candidate may ensure that prior versions remain successful. Plus, they want to know if you can leverage them, creating new interest.


EXAMPLE ANSWER:


“When the next-gen product enters the market, I strive to position the legacy option as a solution for price-sensitive consumers. My goal is to showcase it as a bargain, allowing it to serve as a lower point of entry for customers who may otherwise be priced out. For example, in my last role, I created a marketing campaign that showcased the legacy product as feature-rich yet budget-friendly. The combined approach kept interest in it high and also allowed us to position the next-gen product as a premium version, an approach that also yielded positive results.”
2. For social media marketing, which platforms do you prefer and why?
The social media landscape is always expanding, and many companies don’t know where to focus their energies. They may turn to their marketing experts to figure out which platforms need attention. With this marketing interview question, the hiring manager wants to learn more about how you decide between the slew of options.


EXAMPLE ANSWER:


“Each social media platform has its merits. Plus, they represent different audiences. As a result, I vary my approach based on the product and the ideal consumer. If the goal is to appeal to younger generations, I may favor platforms that resonate with the under-30 group, like Instagram, Snapchat, or TikTok. Facebook and YouTube can be excellent additions for reaching nearly any generation since they rate the highest in overall usage. However, Facebook is essentially a must for targeting adults over 30.
Ultimately, my goal would be to embrace platforms that the target market connects with, allowing me to showcase a product or service in a place they already frequent. That creates the widest reach while remaining relevant to the audience.”


3. Tell me about a marketing trend that’s caught your eye. What about it interests you?
Marketing, like many fields, is ever-evolving. If you aren’t staying on top of trends, your campaigns might not be as effective.


Hiring managers want to know that you’re vigilant about up-and-coming techniques and tools. That’s why they ask you to discuss trends. Additionally, candidates who follow industry news on their own time tend to be more passionate about the field than their less-informed counterparts, giving hiring managers another reason to dig into the topic.


EXAMPLE ANSWER:


“There are quite a few trends that I’ve kept on my radar recently. Shoppable posts have me particularly intrigued, especially on platforms like Instagram. The visual nature of the platform makes it ideal for showcasing certain products, and the ability for users to actively pursue those that interest them allows the initial connection to advance a user through the sales funnel with greater ease. It simplifies the buying process, shortening it dramatically, while also making use of a platform that users already frequent and trust. I think there is a significant amount of potential there, and believe it’s a trend that will quickly become a norm in the marketing industry.”",-0.09721794,0.18140662,0.30213475,-0.1328774,0.064332165,0.034010496,-0.18206267,0.07503843,-0.08446017,0.057544958,0.029881679,-0.056154173,0.23301761,-0.109944604,0.119695716,-0.2661116,0.21560262,0.102971174,-0.29225987,0.19994271,0.17463407,-0.13078089,0.19296572,0.020737419,0.07799663,-0.12913807,-0.056495197,-0.39236045,-0.011688979,-0.13247128,-0.05514968,0.5454778,-0.09148025,0.02023958,0.07825981,0.30125496,0.020882325,0.1711742,-0.06435659,-0.14502227,-0.31659308,-0.27211708,0.08775784,-0.26227412,-0.07677499,0.018072383,0.22600734,-0.28989318,-0.12140237,-0.69762415,0.053065684,-0.037640683,0.040176846,1.0131422,-0.14499065,-2.2488952,0.05104664,-0.28832418,1.6212348,0.40065455,-0.15253736,0.6217192,-0.1854216,0.109818496,0.7486923,0.02733303,0.3558096,0.26004276,0.21079108,-0.24063303,0.010814973,-0.24424148,-0.109435804,-0.3372493,0.11554545,-0.0087404605,-0.14509422,-0.055469245,-0.7482493,-0.05586331,0.53728336,0.04997127,-0.45027047,0.1033063,-1.3145808,-0.20790845,0.11115759,-0.071098834,-0.12852125,-0.33530188,-0.07044656,-0.008988255,-0.13705204,-0.05254358,-0.41733098,-0.09556589,-0.2409168,-0.303887,0.60584426,0.25600785
Document 32,40 Engineering Interview Questions (Plus Sample Answers),"﻿1. What is the most difficult project you have worked on, and how did you get through the challenging tasks?

The interviewer may ask this question as a way to address your awareness of your skill level. Answer honestly with skill sets that you feel you can improve while attending college.


Example: ""I feel that my writing and communication skills can be improved. I plan to use my class time to work on developing my skills in this area. I feel that improving these skills will help me become a better writer and public speaker.""


Do you plan to participate in academic activities outside of class?
This question can serve as a way to assess your interest, motivation and dedication to your college campus. If there are projects, research papers or other academic pursuits you are interested in outside of class, share that in your answer.


Example: ""I am familiar with the academic clubs and opportunities your school offers outside of class, and I'm very interested in getting involved with a political research project. I would even be happy to start a project with other interested classmates.""",-0.101519026,0.2533028,0.24985275,-0.14253211,-0.06293928,0.10313595,-0.2267812,0.15298915,-0.103826076,0.10609317,0.024078837,-0.02443662,0.2550264,0.035328984,0.0004810276,-0.32526517,0.18571153,0.18457371,-0.44678244,0.29535437,0.03149988,-0.05889094,0.16342993,-0.040820785,0.09718664,-0.07525822,-0.108401775,-0.54326,0.10613773,-0.15019116,-0.15753831,0.5834881,-0.09070853,0.010800407,-0.0021981557,0.29228294,-0.060268775,0.2336217,-0.08564554,-0.14057688,-0.38982335,-0.20575443,0.040685117,-0.40628386,-0.20762357,0.0050198184,0.16856234,-0.310884,-0.11585401,-0.82216644,0.018954212,-0.085353576,0.08757657,1.0613027,-0.10918657,-2.303569,0.15346828,-0.2896238,1.6229756,0.42001542,-0.16407707,0.8035222,-0.27582616,0.0211966,0.7556991,0.053394295,0.4292768,0.3288937,0.20300761,-0.223924,0.030926106,-0.2783196,-0.09825228,-0.47509745,0.090202734,0.096717946,-0.14836946,-0.053791396,-0.7735513,-0.07461275,0.53066003,0.11629062,-0.44743326,0.010440705,-1.4535581,-0.11856652,0.084801525,-0.068503514,-0.19786297,-0.3776149,-0.16226764,-0.045384876,-0.023145335,-0.018184757,-0.50345343,-0.008239783,-0.16452676,-0.37790728,0.58122104,0.29588866
Document 37,The 14 College Interview Questions You Must Prepare For,"﻿Question 1: Tell Me About Yourself
This isn't even actually a question, but it's something you might be asked to do in an interview. Because it's so general, you might have trouble figuring out where to begin.


Why they're asking this: Colleges are asking you to do this because they really do want to know more about you. That's one of the primary purposes of the interview, after all!


What they're looking for: You need to paint a unique portrait of who you are to separate yourself from other applicants. Avoid clichés or descriptions that would be too common. For example, don't just say you're hardworking—explain what has driven you to become as diligent as you are and why you feel it is important.


How to prepare: Rehearse answering this question. Try talking about your passions, hobbies, and interests. You can discuss what inspires you or what your friends like about you. Be specific. Again, you want to make yourself memorable.


 


Question 2: Why Are You Interested In This College?
Why they're asking this: This is an important question and one you should definitely prepare for, since colleges want to see that you're taking the application process seriously and have a legitimate interest in attending the school.


What they're looking for: Talk about your interest in a major or academic program, the cultural values of the school, or extracurricular activities that drew you to the college. Again, be thorough and specific. Don't talk about prestige or rankings, and don't say you just want to go there because it's close to home; none of this shows genuine interest in this specific college!


Question 3: Why Do You Want to Major in _____?
If you've indicated that you want to major in a certain subject, you might be asked why you're interested in that particular field.


Why they're asking this: Colleges are interested in your academic goals and want to see that you're academically inclined.
What they're looking for: Talk about why a certain subject inspires you or why you're passionate about it. Don't say that you're pursuing a certain major to make a lot of money or have job security. That doesn't demonstrate genuine academic interest; it just makes you seem shallow.


How to prepare: Think deeply about why you want to pursue a specific major. Why do you find it fascinating? What experiences provoked your interest in the subject? How will the major enable you to reach your future professional goals?
Question 4: What Are Your Academic Strengths?
Why they're asking this: In an effort to get to know you as a student, colleges are interested in getting your perspective on where you excel academically.


What they're looking for: Don't make this answer too short. Don't just say, ""I'm good at science."" When discussing your academic strengths, explain how you've capitalized on your strengths. If you're an excellent writer, for example, how have you used your writing skills to excel in school? How do you plan on continuing to use your strengths?


How to prepare: Make sure you know your academic strengths. You should be able to explain how you recognized your strengths, how you're currently using them, and how you plan to use them in the future.


 


Question 5: What Are Your Academic Weaknesses? How Have You Addressed Them?
Why they're asking this: Colleges want to admit good students, but they're aware everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Colleges want to see that you have the persistence and work ethic to succeed despite your challenges.


What they're looking for: Schools want students who can demonstrate their ability to confront and overcome challenges. Try revealing strategies or specific approaches you've taken to improve your academic weaknesses. You could also tell a specific story about how you managed to do well in a subject that was especially difficult for you.


How to prepare: Be aware of your academic weaknesses and how you've addressed them. It's not good to say that you don't have any weaknesses. That's not very believable, and you'll come off as arrogant.
Question 6: What Do You Plan to Contribute to This School?
Why they're asking this: Colleges want to admit students who will make positive contributions to campus and academic life. Essentially, they're looking for students who will make the school better.


What they're looking for: In short, specifics. Don't limit your answer to vague positive traits. Don't just say you'll contribute a good work ethic and a regard for others. Is there specific research you wish to pursue? Do you want to have a leadership position in an extracurricular activity? Are there specific community service projects you want to do? How will your presence on campus and in the classroom make a difference?
How to prepare: Know the specific contributions you want to make to the school. Identify your college goals as well as the activities you want to pursue while you're in college.


 


Question 7: What Do You Expect to Be Doing 10 Years From Now?
Why they're asking this: Just to set the record straight, you don't need to have your entire future figured out. Colleges understand that you probably won't have everything decided and your plans are likely to change. What they do want is students with direction.


What they're looking for: Colleges want students who are motivated to achieve their goals. The bad, general answer is to only say you expect to have a fulfilling career and be making a positive impact on the world. What are some specific activities you'd like to do? How do you plan on impacting the world? You don't have to limit your plans to professional goals. Do you want to take your mom on a vacation? Or have weekly gatherings with your best friends from high school?


How to prepare: You can write down some detailed notes answering this question. Paint a picture of the life you want to have in 10 years. That picture should reveal your uniqueness.


 


Question 8: What Would You Change About Your High School?
Why they're asking this: With this question, colleges are looking for your ability to identify problems and get a better understanding of what you're looking for in a school. By learning what you'd change, they get a chance to learn more about what matters to you.


What they're looking for: Colleges want a thoughtful response. Be specific and respectful. Don't say, ""I'd get better teachers."" Say that you'd allocate more resources to the music department so that more students can have the opportunity to learn how to play new instruments. Discuss how learning an instrument helped you, and describe the current state of the music department. Try to make it clear that you want to improve your school to benefit the personal and academic growth of all of its students.


How to prepare: Think about the strengths and weaknesses of your high school. What are some specific problems it has? What are the consequences of those problems? What steps would you take to make improvements?
Question 9: Whom Do You Most Admire?
Why they're asking this: From this question, colleges can get a sense of your values. If the person you most admire is Justin Bieber, for example, colleges might wonder about your priorities.


What they're looking for: Don't limit your answer just to naming the person. Why do you admire that person? For instance, many people say that the person they most admire is a parent. But what specifically has that parent done that you admire so much? In short, don't forget the details.
How to prepare: Think deeply about your response to this question. If the person you admire is somebody you know, practice by giving your answer to that person. You'll know you've answered the question well if you're rewarded with a hug or even a few tears from your audience.


 


Question 10: What Is Your Favorite Book?
Why they're asking this: This question is designed to help schools learn more about your interests. Colleges also probably want to make sure that you actually read books.


What they're looking for: Don't limit your answer to the name of a book; think about why you like the book so much. How did it inspire you? Did a particular character resonate with you? Did you learn something from this book that influenced your opinions or behavior? Did this book help shape your perspective or values?


How to prepare: Really think about books you've read that you connected with and why. I've also seen similar questions asking about a news article you recently read, so try to stay up to date with the news, too!
Question 11: Why Do You Want to Go to College?
Why they're asking this: For this question, schools are trying to understand why you're motivated to pursue higher education.


What they're looking for: Colleges want to see you have clear goals you're trying to accomplish by attending college. Obviously, they don't want to hear that you want to go to college because your parents are making you or so you can attend wild parties. In your answer, emphasize how college will allow you to pursue your passions, aid in your personal development, and enable you to fulfill your future goals. Be specific. What are your passions and goals? How will college give you an opportunity to pursue these passions? What college activities will increase your awareness and facilitate your intellectual and emotional growth?


How to prepare: For ideas, check out the pros in my article about if you should go to college.
Question 12: What Do You Like to Do for Fun?
Why they're asking this: This question is designed to get a better sense of your general interests and overall personality.


What they're looking for: Your answer doesn't only have to include activities that are academic. After all, you probably wouldn't be believed if you said all you do for fun is read science textbooks and do math problems. If some of what you do for fun is intellectual, though, explain why you find these activities fun. Finally, try to avoid general answers such as ""hang out with friends.""


How to prepare: You shouldn't have to prepare much for this question since I assume you already know what you like to do for fun. However, spend some time thinking about why you enjoy these activities.
Question 13: What Is an Obstacle You've Faced and How Did You Get Through It?
Why they're asking this: Colleges want to know if you've faced (and overcome) any significant challenges in your life. They also want to see that you're persistent and willing to work hard in order to overcome these obstacles.


What they're looking for: It's fine if you haven't had some awful, incredibly difficult obstacle in your life. Think of a time when you faced a problem that challenged you, and you put in a lot of effort to solve it. Your obstacle could be related to your home life, school, or an extracurricular activity. In your response, explain how the obstacle challenged you and emphasize what exactly you did to overcome it.


How to prepare: Think of a significant challenge you've had in your life and how you dealt with it. What did you learn from the problem? How did you solve it? Did it change or influence the way you address similar problems?
Question 14: What Makes You Unique?
Why they're asking this: This question is essentially what all the other questions above are meant to determine. It's another general question that's often difficult to answer. We are all unique, but it can be hard to put into words exactly what separates you from other people.


What they're looking for: Schools ask this question because they want to get to know you better. You can discuss a trait or multiple traits you possess. Give examples and stories that demonstrate these qualities. Do you have any uncommon interests or goals? Is your background very unique?


How to prepare: I recommend doing some serious brainstorming to address this question. Write out specific attributes and anecdotes you can share that demonstrate your uniqueness. When do you feel most comfortable? What makes you the proudest?",-0.1320865,0.27840936,0.33347633,-0.19609813,-0.14647052,0.1971412,-0.30279523,0.1343654,-0.040490832,0.01345116,0.051921118,0.004138247,0.23242082,-0.012294925,0.04805159,-0.27210724,0.17768823,0.21977055,-0.47821653,0.3338283,0.10086915,-0.077209964,0.1283684,-0.0972372,0.073219106,-0.06691919,-0.13387883,-0.5631006,0.1329338,-0.19768353,-0.1009072,0.55779594,-0.04856848,0.040388145,0.013022403,0.3307266,-0.030859364,0.19570747,0.02188057,-0.16596554,-0.4077418,-0.19434658,0.033331733,-0.46017274,-0.29638124,0.024219884,0.1821189,-0.31345397,-0.1282547,-0.8570017,0.08783658,-0.049515076,0.11117429,1.0417867,-0.15997797,-2.2990997,0.14962135,-0.2623596,1.626406,0.40407518,-0.15239069,0.8322186,-0.29329067,0.023045415,0.8208394,0.042406436,0.5092205,0.3713823,0.12554365,-0.2668055,0.020417264,-0.3007036,-0.09229086,-0.48160753,0.123577565,0.095413215,-0.1442483,-0.06109108,-0.7532412,-0.040431462,0.53446954,0.047717787,-0.5089314,0.01275466,-1.4783276,-0.18900189,0.10186912,-0.040734816,-0.22385192,-0.36888438,-0.12214214,-0.03436405,-0.050275613,-0.13921781,-0.5074156,-0.08277411,-0.20283139,-0.383609,0.536635,0.31817195
Document 38,Common Interview Questions for College Graduates,"﻿Tell me about yourself
Employers are looking for you to briefly talk about your background and show any accomplishments you're particularly proud of. It's best to keep this answer short and to prepare by listing the primary things you want to mention.


Example: ""I recently graduated from the University of Oregon magna cum laude with a Bachelor's of Science in Biology. While I was attending school, I worked part time as a lab assistant for the university and I completed an internship at Prime Labs last summer. I am passionate about pharmaceutical research and hope to join a well-respected pharmaceutical company.""


Why did you choose this career?
When an interviewer asks this question, they want to know how much you understand about the career you're beginning. You have likely done a lot of research during college, which can help, and you can also research the company you're interviewing with and decide what appeals to you about a career with that company.


Example: ""From a young age, I was very interested in science and how modern advancements have affected human lives. I would like to be a research associate so that I can positively affect lives through the research I conduct. I believe that the work is interesting and important.""


Tell me about a project in school that you were particularly proud of. Why were you proud?
Interviewers ask you this to get a sense of what type of work you like to do and what you value in your achievements. This question tells them a great deal about what type of employee you could be, so when preparing for an interview you might want to prepare an answer for this that you feel reflects who you are.


Example: ""For my course in genetics, I researched the genetics of my family tree as part of a project and how those genetics come together in an individual. My focus was primarily on genetics, but I also touched on physical attributes that are passed along over time. This research allowed me to consider how modern medical advances can solve problems that have been passed along through many generations.""


Why did you choose your college?
Your reasons for choosing your college can tell an interviewer a lot about you, including what types of things you value. When answering this question, it's best to focus on the academic or career benefits of your university, and not anything social unless it pertains to the position you're interviewing for. For instance, if you are interviewing for a position across the country, saying you chose a college to stay close to home might tell them you aren't interested in moving. Focusing on academic aspects keeps it professional.


Example: ""The University of Washington was one of many schools I was accepted into, but I went there because I felt their biology program was the most groundbreaking and included professors with really admirable accomplishments in the field. Additionally, I felt their program allowed me to tailor my learning experience to what I was most interested in.""


What goals do you have for your career?
This question tells interviewers if your career plans fit with what they can offer you and if you are realistic about how your industry works. You should keep your stated goals realistic and in line with what that particular company can offer you. It can help to do some research on the types of roles this company offers and what opportunity for advancement there is, especially if you want to work your way up.


Example: ""I would like to work for a well-respected pharmaceutical company researching really any area that can help people. My primary interest is to focus on research, however, I'm not opposed to eventually moving into a management role. I would like to remain with the right company for a long period of time so that I can grow with the company.""


What were your favorite classes? Why?
Interviewers who ask this are trying to understand what about your major was particularly interesting to you. You can use this question as an opportunity to discuss subjects you find interesting, types of projects you enjoyed or professors who influenced you.


Example: ""My favorite two classes were Cell Structure and Function as well as Molecular Biology, as Professor Douglas taught both courses, which covered topics I am extremely interested in. They were challenging classes, but I learned a great deal. The coursework itself pushed me to consider aspects of what living things are made out of that I'd never considered before.""


Where do you see yourself in five years?
This question is a little more specific than the one about your career goals, as the interviewer wants to see if the position you're interviewing for is a good fit for your plans. The best way to prepare to answer this is to be honest with yourself about what you want, but filter it through what this particular company and position can offer you. That way, you avoid telling the interview about expectations that the role you're discussing can't meet. If you can tie it directly into the role you're interviewing for, that's helpful.


Example: ""I would like to be a research associate for a well-respected pharmaceutical company. It doesn't have to be the largest or most famous company, as long as it is a company that offers room for advancement and work that will challenge me. I would like to be a part of a collaborative team that is contributing to important breakthroughs in our field. I believe that working at Chang Pharmaceuticals offers me the ability to reach these goals.""",-0.113032,0.2271046,0.30864224,-0.16183871,-0.05220019,0.13428846,-0.17011568,0.13390064,-0.12523147,0.022916311,0.065769255,-0.040645298,0.25305125,0.008277792,0.07665241,-0.2877624,0.23261508,0.12649526,-0.39325374,0.29753208,0.10343398,-0.052251603,0.15408975,-0.060002085,0.13551973,-0.107320234,-0.10264029,-0.5060112,0.047290597,-0.13829446,-0.17880583,0.55551213,-0.04696939,0.04253483,-0.02289207,0.30913502,-0.043667614,0.2503359,-0.011393006,-0.1641968,-0.4065873,-0.18520914,0.057133175,-0.36898124,-0.19602942,0.023447456,0.20681086,-0.29051664,-0.11419893,-0.75349957,0.067211755,-0.07649633,0.14039887,1.0378015,-0.20017685,-2.320041,0.07053063,-0.27198783,1.5564824,0.446971,-0.12449076,0.8119685,-0.20892672,0.05730484,0.7870158,-0.0014477734,0.49838173,0.3626888,0.16206743,-0.15203196,0.006247301,-0.23506972,-0.09914507,-0.3864786,0.11498989,0.05482266,-0.123055965,-0.06625772,-0.8045082,-0.05242555,0.5233411,0.07180129,-0.4654022,0.07745805,-1.431408,-0.16375974,0.10663815,-0.10699224,-0.2242775,-0.41746238,-0.074062765,-0.107562505,-0.064480394,-0.022896407,-0.47052446,-0.032677058,-0.23255901,-0.3521386,0.56034,0.2907908
Document 39,100 College Admissions Interview Questions and Answers for 2023,"﻿What do you like to do in your spare time?
“I’ve always been a huge football fan. I am currently the captain of my local football team and we play matches every weekend. This sport has made me more persistent and disciplined. It made me understand that hard work pays off, and that you need to focus on your goals if you want to succeed. Being the captain also provided me with some valuable leadership skills. As the captain, it is my job to keep my teammates motivated and come up with strategies to improve our overall performance. Last year I hurt my foot and had to undergo surgery. It was a long recovery, and I couldn’t play for a couple of months. My teammates visited me every week, kept me updated on how the team was doing, and took me for walks just like my doctor had indicated. My team is like a family to me, and they have taught me a lot about teamwork, empathy, and friendship. Playing sports on a regular basis is also a big part of my wellbeing. I don’t play football just for fun, but also as a way of clearing my head, socializing, and staying healthy.”
How would you describe yourself as a student?
“I have always been the kind of student who goes the extra mile. If the teacher offered the possibility to make extra credits, I’d take it. If the essay was supposed to be 10 to 15 pages long, mine would be 15 and a half. My self-discipline and my motivation allowed me to obtain a 3.7 GPA and become one of the top students of my class. In high-school, I tried to get involved in as many extracurricular activities as I could. I edited the school yearbook, helped organize charity events in my local community, and joined a book club. I hope during college I’ll be able to expand my spectrum and find new activities to take part in. I can only imagine where my enthusiasm and potential will take me in a school with so many academic opportunities!”
What makes you unique?
“I am the oldest of 5 siblings. Unfortunately, my dad passed away a few years ago and I immediately felt the responsibility to take his place. My mom started working two jobs and was never around, so it became my duty to make sure my little siblings were looked after. I would make them lunch and dinner, help them with their homework and put them to bed. I didn’t mind doing any of it as long as it meant helping my family. Fortunately, my mom found a better job and our lives could go back to what they were, but I had already learned a lesson for life. I know this school has high standards, and only those students with the strongest determination, solid study techniques and a deep sense of responsibility can excel here. I believe my life experiences make me unique. I don’t take things for granted anymore; I am aware of the sacrifices one must make to achieve one’s goals. Even though I faced many challenges during high school, I managed to achieve a high GPA, thanks to my hard work and self-discipline. Regardless of what the future holds for me, one thing is for sure: I will never give up, and I believe a student like me would be greatly appreciated in this institution.”
Why did you choose to apply to our school?
“When I first started looking for my ideal school, I focused on diversity. I was attracted by the size of this school and by the fact that it accepts international students. I believe socializing and surrounding yourself with people from all nationalities and backgrounds is extremely enriching and something I wanted to experience during my time in college. For the same reason, I found this school’s exchange program extremely attractive. The variety of destinations and possibilities your program offers is outstanding and hard to find in a school. If I get accepted, I hope I can benefit from it and live an experience abroad.”
Why do you want to major in [your major of choice]?
“I have always been interested in science. While other kids my age would watch cartoons after school, I preferred documentaries about space, nature, and evolution. I developed an insatiable curiosity about the world that I have even today. What fascinated me the most about science, is that we haven’t yet found all the answers, there’s always something more to discover. My performance in school reflected my interests. I always achieved the highest grades in subjects such as math, biology, and physics. Chemistry, however, was my favorite one. Chemistry class wasn’t just about books and theoretical knowledge, it also involved performing experiments and drawing conclusions, just like real scientists. In fact, one of the reasons I found this school so attractive was its state-of-the-art lab and the fact that its chemistry program involves subjects like practical chemistry and laboratory techniques. I believe this program fits my ambitions perfectly and will help me become the scientist I aspire to be.”",-0.058053244,0.21072182,0.27574676,-0.19968754,-0.0549696,0.18277292,-0.15811785,0.1961414,-0.16432746,0.06635638,0.089200206,-0.043348778,0.24427581,0.0538713,0.05335804,-0.30256552,0.18116054,0.14796853,-0.42438835,0.298686,0.14226365,-0.008673034,0.1803256,-0.026298193,0.16899605,-0.09110683,-0.14553048,-0.5106316,0.10355736,-0.11766041,-0.16679867,0.53058785,-0.0552883,0.062434066,-0.013486116,0.28399226,-0.0537521,0.28292024,-0.06648437,-0.15043281,-0.39293596,-0.19523613,0.1589438,-0.37074322,-0.12608354,0.034309477,0.2131607,-0.2815927,-0.018289756,-0.75293785,-0.034696475,-0.09266406,0.0783135,1.0676142,-0.177611,-2.3515816,0.0463444,-0.23237929,1.5227901,0.42937085,-0.09499062,0.8103069,-0.2563535,0.07631113,0.7253426,-0.012349438,0.4730962,0.30312556,0.19518335,-0.14357883,0.028410831,-0.25160348,-0.045189407,-0.3502874,0.13740021,0.16220298,-0.13914226,-0.04149811,-0.78086907,-0.033882227,0.5425438,0.13354896,-0.41785002,0.07091517,-1.38978,-0.17592105,0.040689707,-0.10844334,-0.21738139,-0.34510595,-0.09457424,-0.1041975,-0.037528824,0.054332055,-0.52307403,-0.0581112,-0.2756886,-0.3255702,0.5221238,0.2688857

“I've been a hostess at XYZ Restaurant for just over two years and I greet and seat customers, assess wait times, fulfill to-go orders and answer the phones.

2. What makes you unique?
Employers often ask this question to identify why you might be more qualified than other candidates they’re interviewing. To answer, focus on why hiring you would benefit the employer. Since you don’t know the other applicants, it can be challenging to think about your answer in relation to them. Addressing why your background makes you a good fit lets employers know why your traits and qualifications make you a strong candidate.


To help you prepare this answer consider the following:


Assets the employers finds valuable: Review the job description for role responsibilities as well as required and desired skills, qualities, experience and qualifications. For example, if a position emphasizes cross-collaboration, you might communicate your ability to unite a team around a common goal.
Ways you've been successful in previous roles: Reflect on past accomplishments and list the qualities that helped you achieve them. For example, if you received an award for your marketing skills you might share this along with the project or experience that earned you the award.
Traits or skills you've been praised for: Consider your strengths and qualities commonly recognized by previous employers or coworkers. Think back to positive feedback you’ve received from performance reviews and completed projects. For example, if your employer consistently brings up your ability to motivate others in your performance reviews, it’s likely a trait they highly value and other employers would also appreciate.
""What makes me unique is my ability to meet and exceed deadlines. In my previous role, my manager consistently praised me for completing my projects efficiently with a high level of quality. This allowed me to take on additional responsibilities and eventually led to a promotion.""

In your answer, mention the aspects of the company that appeals to you and aligns with your values and career goals.


“The company’s mission to help college grads pay off their student loan debt resonates with me.

Hiring managers often ask this question to ensure you understand the role and give you an opportunity to highlight your relevant skills. Study the job description carefully and compare its requirements to your skills and experience.


In your answer, choose a few responsibilities you particularly enjoy or excel at and focus on those in your answer.


“While I highly valued my time at my previous company, there are no longer opportunities for growth that align with my career goals.

Employers ask this question to gauge your level of self-awareness and ensure your sources of motivation align with the role and company. To answer, be as specific as possible, provide real-life examples and tie your answer back to the job role and/or the company’s mission


Consider asking yourself these questions to prepare your answer:


What did a great day at work look like in your previous role and why?
What made you choose your profession or field?
What prompted you to apply for the role when you read the job description?
“Making a true difference in the lives of my patients and their families motivates me to strive for excellence in everything I do.

6. What are your greatest strengths?
In your answer to this question, share your most relevant technical and soft skills. While it may feel uncomfortable to speak highly of yourself, remember that this is your opportunity to tell your interviewers what makes you a great candidate. To answer, follow the formula below:


1. Share one to a few positive qualities and personal attributes: ""I’ve always been a natural leader...”


2. Back them up with examples: ""...I’ve exceeded my KPIs every quarter and have been promoted twice in the past five years. I look back at those successes and know that I wouldn’t have reached them if I hadn’t built and led teams composed of highly skilled and diverse individuals. I’m proud of my ability to get cross-functional groups on the same page...”


3. Relate them back to the role for which you’re interviewing: ""...I’ve also regularly honed my management skills through 360 reviews and candid sessions with my team, and I know continuing to build my leadership skills is something I want from my next role.”


7. What are your greatest weaknesses?
It can feel awkward to discuss your weaknesses in an environment where you’re expected to focus on your accomplishments. However, when answered correctly, sharing your weaknesses shows that you are self-aware with an interest in continued growth and learning—traits that are extremely attractive to many employers. Consider using this formula for your response:


1. Select an actual weakness (not a strength) that's honest but professionally relevant: ""I’m naturally shy...”


2. Add context: ""...From high school and into my early professional interactions, it sometimes prevented me from speaking up...”


3. Provide a specific example:"" ...After being a part of a workgroup that didn’t meet our strategic goals two quarters in a row, I knew I owed it to my team and myself to confidently share my ideas...”


4. Explain how you overcame or are working to overcome it: ""...I joined an improv acting class. It’s fun and has really helped me overcome my shyness. I learned practical skills around leading discussions and sharing diverse perspectives. Now, in group settings, I always start conversations with the quieter folks. I know exactly how they feel, and people can be amazing once they start communicating.”


8. What are your goals for the future?
Hiring managers often ask about your future goals to determine whether or not you’re looking to stay with the company long-term. Additionally, this question is used to gauge your ambition, expectations for your career and ability to plan ahead. The best way to handle this question is to examine your current career trajectory and how this role helps you reach your long-term goals.


“I would like to continue developing my marketing expertise over the next several years. One of the reasons I’m interested in working for a fast-growing startup company is that I’ll have the ability to wear many hats and collaborate with many different departments. I believe this experience will serve me well in achieving my ultimate goal of someday leading a marketing department.”

9. Where do you think you'll be in five years?
Understanding how you imagine your life in the future can help employers understand whether the trajectory of the role and company fits in with your personal development goals.


To answer this question you can provide specific career goals including any dream roles or projects:


""Some of my future goals for the next few years include leading a design team in a formal capacity. I’m also excited about the prospect of working with product and event teams on developing streamlined processes—this is a natural fit with my project management background. I’d also like to further develop my skills in user experience to aid in creating more user-focused designs all around.”

10. Can you tell me about a difficult work situation and how you overcame it?
This question is often used to assess how well you perform under pressure as well as your problem-solving abilities. Keep in mind stories are more memorable than facts and figures, so strive to “show” instead of “tell.” This is also an excellent opportunity to show your human side and how when faced with adversity you are able to persevere.


For this question, consider sticking to the STAR method, which stands for Situation, Task, Action and Result or learning.


“It was the first day of my boss’s two-week vacation and our agency’s highest-paying client threatened to leave because he didn’t feel he was getting the personalized service he was promised. I spent my lunch hour on the phone with him discussing his concerns. We even brainstormed ideas for his next campaign. He was so grateful for the personal attention that he signed another six-month contract before my boss even returned from her trip.”

11. How do you respond to stress or change?
How you handle stressful situations and adapt to change is an indicator of your ability to solve problems. Employers want to hire candidates who react to stress constructively, so it’s important that your answer to this question demonstrates personal growth.


Spend some time thinking about your response to stressful situations and provide an example that communicates your abilities around perseverance, resilience and stress management.


“I’m able to stay calm by focusing on the bigger picture and breaking down my projects into smaller tasks. I always start by asking myself, “What is the ultimate goal I’m trying to achieve?” From there, I make a list of immediate and long-term action items with achievable but ambitious deadlines. Even if the big project is due tomorrow, I ask myself, ‘What’s something I can tackle in the next 30 minutes?’ Before I know it, I’ve made significant progress and that impossible project doesn’t seem so impossible.”




Read more: Interview Question: “How Do You Handle Stress?”
12. How do you handle conflict at work?
Employers ask this question to gauge how you interact with various stakeholders or colleagues of differing opinions. Often, being the right person for the job involves more than just hard skills, hiring managers also value candidates who can collaborate with others and approach conflict in a productive way.


A good answer will discuss a time you encountered a conflict with a colleague, client or manager and maintained the patience to resolve it. It’s important to relay what you learned—how you grew personally and professionally—as a result of the experience. Use the STAR method to construct your response.


“I was working as a project manager on an IT project, and one technician was constantly late finishing tasks. When I approached him about it, he got defensive, so I kept calm and acknowledged that the deadlines were challenging and asked how I could help him meet expectations. He told me that he had been pulled into another project so I met with the other project manager and we came to a resolution that lightened the technician’s workload. For the remainder of the project, the technician delivered great work. I learned that you don’t always know what others are experiencing and by keeping that in mind, you can better navigate conflict and be a more helpful and supportive colleague.”

13. What is your greatest accomplishment?
It’s easy to get hung up on figuring out your single most impressive accomplishment. Instead, think of a few achievements that showcase your work ethic and values. If you can, pick examples that also tie back to the job you’re applying for. The STAR method is a great tool to ensure you highlight the most relevant parts of your story.


“In my last role, I managed all of the company's social media content. I noticed other brands were experimenting with videos and seeing great engagement from their customers, so I asked my boss if we could do a low-budget test. She agreed, so I produced a video cheaply in-house that drove double the engagement we normally saw on our social channels. It also drove conversions with 30% of viewers visiting our website within a week of seeing the video.”

14. How do you define success?
Employers ask this to help them understand how your definition of success influences your goals and how you measure them. A good answer will show that you know how to define and measure goals and you’re willing to challenge yourself and work hard to meet them.


Consider your proudest achievements, your long- and short-term successes and how the company you’re interviewing with views success. Give specific examples of how you’ve succeeded in the past.


“I define success as fulfilling my role in my team and in the company. I work toward completing my individual duties as effectively as possible, balancing that with professional growth and contributing to larger organizational goals. In my previous role, success meant exceeding weekly metrics, implementing processes that supported the company’s KPIs and meeting quarterly professional development goals.”




Read more: Interview Question: ""How Do You Define Success?""
15. How do your skills align with this role?
While this is similar to questions like “Why should we hire you?” or “What can you bring to the company?” it allows you to be more specific about your work ethic, style and unique abilities as it relates to the role.


An impactful answer will discuss your hard and soft skills and use the STAR method to illustrate how your unique skills might benefit the team or organization.


“I can make anyone feel comfortable in a new environment, which makes me a good fit as a human resources assistant. In my previous position, a new employee came to me and told me that she didn’t think she was right for the company culture. After talking for a few minutes, we realized that she felt too much pressure to participate in company events. I started introducing events that involved fewer competitions and more casual environments, and she quickly grew more comfortable with her team.”




Read more: Interview Question: ""What Skills Would You Bring to the Job?""
16. Why should we hire you?
While this question may seem like an intimidation tactic, interviewers generally ask to offer another opportunity to explain why you’re the best candidate. Your answer should address the skills and experience you offer, why you’re a good culture fit and what you believe you’d bring to the role.


One thing to remember as you’re discussing your fitness for the company with employers is that the idea of “culture fit” can sometimes be used as a way to eliminate and discriminate against candidates, however unknowingly, who don’t think, act or look like existing employees.


A better alternative concept you might consider addressing is “culture add,” or your ability to bring fresh and additive ideas and feedback to the team. Culture adds make the company stronger by diversifying the experiences and perspectives of its workforce.


“My experience accurately managing inventory intake and skills in creating effective, streamlined schedules make me uniquely qualified to succeed in this kitchen manager position. I understand that you require a highly organized candidate with acute attention to detail. In my previous job, I successfully handled schedules for 20 employees and reduced food waste by 15%. I’m confident in my ability to use my organizational skills to bring efficiency and order to your restaurant.""

17. Why are you leaving your current job?
There are many acceptable reasons for leaving a job. Prepare a thoughtful answer that will give your interviewer confidence that you’re being deliberate about this job change. Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of your current or previous role, focus on the future and what you hope to gain in your next position.

18. What is your salary range expectation?
Interviewers ask this question to make sure your expectations are in line with the amount they’ve budgeted for the role. If you give a salary range exceedingly lower or higher than the market value of the position, it gives the impression that you don’t know your worth. Here are three ways to approach this response:


Provide a range
Research the typical compensation range for the role on Indeed Salaries and make the low end of your range your lowest acceptable salary. For example, if you require at least $50,000 annually, you might offer the interviewer a range of $50,000-$60,000 per year. Let the hiring manager know if you’re flexible.


“My salary expectation is between $XX,XXX and $XX,XXX, which is the average salary for a candidate with my level of experience in this city. However, I am flexible and willing to discuss.”




Include negotiation options
There may be other benefits, perks or forms of compensation you find just as valuable as your salary.


“I am seeking a position that pays between $75,000 and $80,000 annually, but I am open to negotiating salary depending on benefits, bonuses, equity, stock options and other opportunities.”




Deflect the question
If you’re early in the hiring process and still learning the specifics of the job duties and expectations, you may want to deflect the question for later in the conversation.


“Before I answer, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a better idea of what the position entails. That way, I can provide a more accurate expectation.”




If you’re unsure about what salary is appropriate to ask for the position you’re applying to, visit Indeed's Salary Calculator to get a free, personalized pay range based on your location, industry and experience.


19. Do you have any questions?
This might be one of the most important questions asked during the interview process because it allows you to explore any topics that haven’t been addressed and shows the interviewer you’re serious about the role.


Remember that you are interviewing the company too. Take time to ask the interviewer questions about their own experiences with the company, gain tips on how you can succeed if hired and address any lingering questions you have. Some examples include:


What do you love most about working for this company?
What would success look like in this role?
