grave menace to the entire  world affecting millions of 
people. Besides being detrimental to human health, it also 
have negative repercussions on the global business world

and commerce. The outburst of the diseases was first 
identified in Wuhan, china in December 2019. World 
Health Organizations (WHO) has been thoroughly 
monitoring and assessing its global hazards, thus 
declaring it as a Public Health Emergency of international 
concern on 30th January 2020. The virus started 
disse minating at an unprecedented rate in different 
countries across the globe compelling WHO to proclaim 
it as pandemic on 11th March 2020. Now the whole  world

In India, the first case of coronavirus disease 
was reported in Kerala on January 30, 2020. Multiple 
cases were than reported in different cities in India.  
Hence, t he Government of India took necessary action by 
announcing lockdown in every corner of the country on 
24th March 2020. The metropolises of Delhi, Mumbai, 
Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai are densely populated 
which has giv en rise to a spurt in cases of c ovid-19 and 
these cities are the engines for growth and development of Indian economy. The pandemic has led to 
socioeconomic disruption, inhibiting the growth of entire 
economic environment.  Thus in this article, an attempt  is 
made to identify t he potentia l impacts of c oronavirus on 
different sectors  of India n economy also highlight ing the 
business strategies that are necessary for business 
sustainability to grapple with the present scenario.  
 
II. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY  
 
The whole business world is in the clutch of 
coronavirus. The impact of the virus being severe and 
swifter, the companies need to deal with this situation by 
framing proper strategies in order to survive this hard 
time. Therefore, the objectives of this study are:  
 To highlight the impact of  coronavirus on the 
different sectors of the Indian economy.

III. IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUS ON 
DIFFERENT SECTORS OF THE 
ECONOMY  
 
Covid -19 has set foot in India and is heading the 
nation to major downturn. Co ronavirus disease has 
become a world -changing event  and is not only a 
humanitarian crisis but also economic a nd social crisis. 
Its impact  on the business environment is  worldwide  and 
manifold . Due to the rapid  spread  of coronavirus, several 
entities are bo und to limit their business operations 
leading to disruption in the economic activities of several  
industries that drives growth. The setback that is being 
encountered by the different sectors of the economy are 
highlighted below.  
Primary Sector : Primary sector encompasses 
industries associated with extraction and production of 
raw materials. This sector provides employment to about 
43.21% of the population in India and contributes about 
16.1% of the Indian GDP. It supplies raw materials to

 seconda ry sector and furnishes basic necessities of human 
life. 
 Agricultural industry:  In agricultural sector, due 
to travel restrictions for lockdown , there has been a dearth 
of agricultural worke rs which has resulted in drop in  
production. Also the pandemic loc kdown period 
coincides with the harvesting season of ‘Rabi’ crop, but 
owing to paucity of labourers the crops unabatedly stays 
in the field. As the operations of the businesses like 
hotels, restaurants, sweet shops and tea shops are 
suspended, the market o f raw materials which are used 
for these purpose has gone down leading to grievances of 
farmers. There is a significant fall in revenue of the tea 
based industries as they export a substantial part of their 
output which is now barred.  
 Mining industry:  The pandemic has curtailed the 
overall demand for metals and minerals  which has 
trimmed down their prices. The mining entities has also 
experienced drastic drop in their share prices.  
Secondary sector: The secondary sector 
provides employment to around 24 .89% of the population 
in India and contributes about 29.6% of the Indian GDP. 
It embraces industries that produces and distributes 
finished goods or in indulged in construction activities, 
thus providing support to both the primary and service 
sector.  
 Manufacturing industries: Manufacturing 
industries are bearing the brunt of coronavirus as they had 
terminated their production at a short notice. The value of 
the inventories that are held up in the production centers 
or w arehouse of these industries has  gone down  and the 
machineries are too lying idle for a long time. Major 
hindrance encountered by the industries are cash flow 
constraints and supply chain disruption.  
 Automobile industry: With almost all plants shut 
and imports being sealed up, there is a  steep decline in 
production and sales of the automobile companies 
impelling them to declare pay cuts. The situation will be 
awful even during post lockdown period due to fall in 
income levels.  
 Textile and Apparel industry: This industry is  
workplace for o ver 45 million people in the country but 
temporary closure of production units has increased their 
hurdles leading to lay -offs. The termin ation of exports 
and imports have  adverse impact on the spinning mills in 
India as the exports of fabric, yarn and oth er materials 
have disrupted.  
 Pharmaceutical  and C hemical industries : The se 
industries highly count  on import of bulk drugs  and 
several raw materials from China. Due to import 
restrictions these industries are  also impacted.  
 Electronic industry: The finish  products plus the 
raw materials used in this industry is mainly supplied by 
China. The spread of  coronavirus have pushed down the 
production and sale of  electronic goods and the supply 
chain is also interrupted.  
 Solar power industry: Solar power project 
builders depend on Chinese imports. Around 80% of solar modules and solar cell used in India are from 
Chinese manufacturers. Thus, the Indian solar project 
developers started confronting shortage of raw materials 
and have limited stocks.  
 Construction and engineering industries:  For 
construction and engineering industries, the physical 
presence of massiv e labour force is essential which  is 
restrained during lockdown and the construction activities 
have also halted. Thus the industries are  tormenting at the 
hands of ruthless coronavirus.  
Service sector: About 31.9% of the Indian 
population is employed in service sector which 
contributes about 54.3% of the Indian GDP.  
 Tourism and ho spitality industries : Tourism and 
hosp itality are the foremost industrie s to be  severely 
affected amid coronavirus crisis and will also be rearmost 
one to behold resumption of activities. Lockdown has 
averted the inflow of tourists dealing a crippling blow to 
the tourism and hospitality  industries . 
 Transportation segment: The pandemic has put 
down this segment under massive financial strain. 
Airlines, cruise and road cargo operators has been struck 
hard because of border closure and travel restrictions. 
Some of the aviation companies are not even in the 
position to refund their  customers those who had booked 
flights that were cancelled due to lockdown.  
 Healthcare segment:  According to FICCI, 
healthcare segment is at the epicenter of these worldwide 
pandemic ordeal. Certain p ublic hospitals have witnessed 
increase in demand in th e crisis period. The private 
hospitals have arisen to the occasion by providing the 
government with all the succour it requires.  
 IT segment:  IT segment is reeling under 
coronavirus crisis as there is immense dwindle in global 
deal activities as well as gro wth rate. They are 
downsizing their work force to tussle with the presence 
scenario.  
 BFSI segment:  Covid -19 has afflicted BFSI 
segment by causing upheaval to their business and annual 
reporting  giving rise to their nonperforming loans . During 
this emergen cy situation, the operational and technical 
difficulties faced by the employees as well as the 
customers spotlighted the lack of agility in the banking 
and financial system.  
 Media and entertainment industry : Coronavirus  
has compelled to postpone release of  several movies, 
shootings have come to rest and the theatres cannot 
screen movies br inging about heavy loss to this industry .  
 Retail segment:  shutting down of shops and 
malls that do not sell necessity goods have brought 
forth degrowth in revenue and considerable job loss. 
Retail stores selling essential commodities have 
witnessed demand of the products exceeding supply 
engendering bare retail shelves.

BENEFITED?

 The pandemic outbreak has got in the way of 
Indian economy, but the  foremost opportunity that India 
will get  is the reliability crisis for C hina. The world 
seems to attenuate their dependency on China. Some 
countries even have expressed their opinions regarding 
desisting their trading relationship with China. 
Coronavirus can wind up being the final curtain on the 
leading role played by China in the global market since it 
is the world’s largest manufacturing hub. China’s 
discomfort can turn into India’s comfort as the turmoil 
caused by coronavirus that has originated in Chi na could 
set the stage for more foreign i nvestments in India which 
is one of the emerging economies in the world . The 
countries those are putting aside China can place India in 
that position. The reasons for which India can grab the 
place of China can be j ot down as follows:  
 India is the second largest country in terms of 
population, so the domestic demand in India is 
very high.  It also  has a huge market.  
 In India the averag e age is 29 years, so there is a 
presence of  huge youth population  in India . 
Therefore, the availability of workforce is high. 
The labour is also cheap here.  
 India is the world’s fifth largest economy 
according to no minal  GDP and third largest in 
terms of purchasing power parity.  
 India has the fourth largest rail transportation 
network and third largest road network which 
can facilitate easy transportation of goods.  
 India is the second largest English speaking 
nation in the world.  
 Indian products are more reliable than Chinese 
products.  
 India has a c heap digital  communication 
netw ork and is one of the largest  and swiftly -
evolving markets for the digitalusers. With more 
than 5 6 crores  internet subscribers, India has the 
second highest  number of internet user 
population in the planet .  
 The government of India had launched certain 
programs like Skill India, Digital India, Make in 
India and Smart cities to foster economic growth 
which have created a business friendly 
environment in the nation.  
 The basic amenities that are essential to carry 
out a business is much affordable in India, either 
it be infrastructural investment, labour cost, 
transportation expenses, food or internet.  
 Besides all this, in India, the judiciary system is 
an independent body.  
 
V. BUSINESS SURVIVAL 
STRATEGIES  
 
Getting the better of this pandemic crisis and its 
aftermath is imperative at this time. The business world 
need to bite the bullet of coronavirus catastrophe and 
should come to grips with it by means of proper business strategies. Near -term persistence is  the only scheme for 
survival of certain entities while the rest are peering 
through the fog of ambiguity, finding the way to position 
themselves after the crisis flames out and things get back 
to normal. What the scenario will be in near future is 
unknown , so we need to take into account the lessons of 
the past and ponder productively and adroitly about the 
future.  To surmount the current situation is hard nut to 
crack mainly for the secondary and service sectors. They 
will either subsist, struggle, strive  or shut down hinged on 
their financial capability, management technique and 
leadership style. To survive in t his pandemic period, the 
organiz ations should  adopt certain strategies to transform 
panic into constructive and proactive action.  
 Firstly, every o rganisation need to  understand 
the present external environment , for which  they n eed to 
conduct PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, 
Technological, ecological and Legal) analysis. Analyzing 
political environment  will provide information abou t the 
administrative decisions and measures taken by both the 
central and state governments.  This will help the business 
to avail the benefits provided by the government which 
may soothe their business operations in this  turmoil. For 
instance, government has ext ended the due dates for 
filling return, reduced the TDS rate,  also provided 3 
months moratorium on loan repayment  and so on. 
Appraising economic environment  will throw light on the 
present economic situation  of the country , pur chasing 
power of the consumer , change in their taste and 
preferences, volatility in demand and supply, etc . Social 
aspects will give information about the demand of the 
society. At present, social distancing, safety 
measures ,disinfection  has become very relevant. 
Technology related ch anges need to be properly assessed  
to ride on the technological wave by upgrading and 
innovat ing products otherwise the business can lose 
market.  At present, this has become a very important 
issue which every business need to consider first.  Current 
ecolog ical condition is also important to know as certain 
changes has taken place due to complete lockdown of 
most of the countries around the planet . Legal 
environme nt should also be properly analyzed in order to 
know the legality of the business . For instance,  
government has announced that retail price of 200ml of 
sanitizer can be maximum Rs. 100 only.  
 Then  the enterprise s should conduct internal 
analysis to appraise their current position . They should 
properly know their  core competent area, av ailability of 
resources and manpower and their capabilities.  However, 
during this turbulent period, the senior officials of the 
company should assume utmost responsibility of 
managing and directing the organisation. More powers 
should be bestowed upon the CEO and CFO by the Board 
so that they do not confront impediment while taking 
urgent decisions in the period of crisis. During this 
unprecedented time, the executive directors of the 
company including  the CEO and CFO should play the 
role of crisis managers  and guide the organisation

 towards better performance. They should be efficient in 
organizing the available resources properly to accomplish 
their present objective. As well as , they need to identify 
the critical uncertainties and must take a lead in desi gning 
contingency plans and developing plausible scenarios so 
as to overcome the crisis situation.  
 On basis on internal and external analysis, the 
entities should use SWOT analysis  to correctly identify 
its strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats . 
Strength recounts what an enterprise excels at  and in what 
it is unique compared to its competitors. Whether it has 
skilled workforce, better knowhow or technology, loyal 
customer base, adequate capital, strong brand image , 
better equipment, ideal location  and so on . Weaknesses 
will help an organisation to identify its internal weakness 
or what it lacks such as inadequate capital, high debt 
pressure, shortage of skilled workers, weak brand, 
resource limitations, inadequate supply chain, etc. The se 
inhibit  an entity from operating at its optimum level so 
the organisation must develop the se areas to remain 
competitive. Opportunities  indicates the auspicious 
external factors which might give  rise to certain 
competitive advantages  for an enterprise . Thus, 
oppo rtunities  need to be properly determined as it will 
help an organisation to expand  its business. Based on the 
current scenario, the demand for new products can be 
identified. For example, demand can rise for safety -
enhancing products like sanitizer, masks,  disinfectants,  
hand washes, gloves, etc. Threats  refer to all those 
external factors that poses a risk to the entity or its 
likelihood of growth and prosperity. Therefore, the 
threats that has arisen due to the pandemic outbreak 
should be discerned. The c hange in customer behavior, 
new competitors, supply chain disruption, change in 
regulatory environment, etc. should be assessed. 
Companies need to minimize its threats by using its 
strengths and should try to eliminate its weaknesses by 
utilizing the oppor tunities identified.  
 The ability to absorb a shock and deal with it i.e. 
resiliency is the key to survive in the crisis and vital  for 
long-term prosperity. Resilience capabilities of the 
entities must be reinforced to respond to the aftermath of 
unforeseen events.  They need to have the capability  to 
plan for and adjust to any change through forecasting, 
safeguarding,  responsive capa bility and reviving and 
recovering strategy. Entities need to delineate its crucial 
functions and emphasize those which are critical to be 
carried out during crisis. Firms should recognize what 
their vulnerabilities are and how can they prepare 
themselves to remain in business.  
 Firms need to rethink their business model, 
concentrate on their core business area, revive their 
strategies, rework their plans and policies, try to explore 
new markets , embrace new sales channel and find more 
opportunities to grow . Companies should focus on zero 
base budgeting by starting from zero and including only 
those expenditures which are essential to withstand the 
current situation.   Business should ensure agility in their 
operations, strategies, etc. so that they can respo nd 
swiftly and efficiently to any threats or opportunities 
whether it be from e xternal or internal environment.  
 Technology  is one of the vital aspect which the 
companies need to focus on. At present, every business 
should concentrate on digitalization sinc e social 
distancing is a prime issue today.  This plight seems to 
provide a glimpse of the future scenario where digital 
would become the heart of every interaction and 
communication. Crisis periods often act as catalyst for 
new technological developments an d innovations. Digital 
technolog y can help the companies to alleviate the effect 
of coronavirus.  From on -premises systems, the entities 
need to switch over to hybrid cloud services. Customer 
experience should be enhanced by using technology, 
financial and  operational based software need to be 
upgraded, a more pliable and dynamic work environment 
need to be created.  Artificial intelligence should be 
adopted by the business to attenuate t he effect of this  
catastrophe.   
 Digitalization gives rise to several cybercrimes 
so additional consideration should be given to 
cybersecurity.  
 Earnest attention need to be given on marketing 
which is one of the key function of the business. Entities 
should try to embrace digital marketing technology since 
offline shopping i s likely to be replaced by online 
shopping. Customer behaviour and habits have been 
affected by the pandemic thus online -shopping is 
expected to experience a notable surge in post -lockdown 
period. Therefore, ecommerce should be emphasized.  
 Digital communic ation should also be 
encouraged.  
 One of the serious impact of Coronavirus is 
disruption of supply chain which need to be stabilized. 
The entities that are mainly depended on other countries 
for raw materials will face more hurdles. The 
organizations requir e to devise their future supply chain 
designs  and should diversify their supply channels from 
geographical standpoint in order to attenuate supply -side 
risk. The entities can also make an effort to localize at 
leasta certain part of their supply channel. T his will 
augment investment in local industries of India and will 
be a shot in the arm for Indian economy which is in 
distress now. For instance, in relation to pharmaceutical 
industry, the Indian government has  taken the decision to 
promote bulk d rug parks and manufacturing of active 
pharmaceuticals ingredients and critical key starting 
materials in the country. This will help to restore the 
supply chain disruption in pharmaceutical segment.  
 Business must re -assess their stocking strategies 
in light of the  risk associated with the supply chain, 
volatility in demand and supply, liquidity and 
perishability.  
 Increase in unemployment level due to job loss 
of several employee s and measures like pay cuts have  
reduced the purchasing power of the people. They can

 curtail down their cost related to luxury items to buy 
necessary items. So, the demand for luxury items may fall 
and necessity goods may increase.  Therefore, firms can 
prioritize necessary goods and safety -ensuring 
products. Even in this circumstances, certa in enterprises 
have experienced a rise in their demand and created new 
job opportunities. These are internet or broadband service 
providers, online media and entertainment companies  
including social media , e learning, digital payment, 
pharmaceuticals, disi nfectants, financial technology, 
medical equipment, etc.  
 Entities  should focus on their core customer 
segments and need to predict their behavioural changes 
due to coronavirus. Certainly, the consumption pattern 
will change for the crisis. So, the firms  should rebuild 
their customer base and maintain contact with the key 
customers to strengthe n loyalty and get their support.  
 Entities should ensure that adequate amount of 
liquidity is there to weather the crisis . They need to 
evaluate  their financial cond ition in each scenario and 
should take necessary measures like reducing cost, 
accounts receivables and payables optimization, 
divestments, merger and acquisition s and so on  to 
stabilize the enterprise in every scenario. Cash flows must 
be properly managed to ensure that liquidity problems do 
not harm the employees and outsourced labourers.  
 Highly leveraged entities will be more affect ed 
than the unleveraged one . High  leveraged entities facing 
difficulties can obtain for certain temporary relief in their 
contractual obligations.  
 Companies need to  figure out  the availability of 
workforce as there may be unavailability of outsourced 
and migrant labourers for certain period of time. 
Companies should also ensure labour health and safety in 
the workplace for carry ing out the operational activities 
properly.  
 Lastly, t o keep the business buoyant in course of 
challenging period, a robust business continuity and 
disaster management plan is required. Every business 
should have such plan to cope with the difficulties and  
uncertainties that may arise anytime during the course of 
business. Such framework outlines the strategies and 
plann ing processes which are  required for fabricating 
prior mechanisms and procedures that will en able an 
enterprise to respond in the critical period in such a way 
that crucial activities and operations can be  continued  
within projected level of disruption. Business continuity  
plan should incorporate  certain matters. Firstly, assessment of risk to identify the potential loss to the 
business durin g the crisis. Secondly, mitigating risk 
through eliminating loopholes and lacunas and 
safeguarding business operations and assets.  Thirdly, t he 
plan should properly and precisely specify the business 
continuity strategies  that should be adopted during the 
crisis period . A planning team need to  be build up clearly 
specifying their roles and responsibilities. Lastly, for 
proper implementation of the plan, training session need 
to be carried out of the involved professionals.  This will 
help the enterprises to carry out their normal business 
operations during crisis period with marginal disruption.
